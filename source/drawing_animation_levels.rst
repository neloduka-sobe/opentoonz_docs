Drawing Animation Levels
========================
In OpenToonz it is possible to create and draw **Toonz Vector** levels (PLI format), **Toonz Raster** levels (TLV format) and standard **Raster** levels (TIF format) directly in the viewer. Drawing tools can also be used for touch-up in cleaned up drawings, and loaded raster images.

.. _drawing_in_toonz:

Drawing In OpenToonz
--------------------
To draw an animation level, first you have to define its type: Toonz Vector, Toonz Raster or Raster; and its settings like its name, the number of frames it's made of and the way its drawings are numbered.

Toonz Vector levels are defined by drawing of vector strokes; strokes and areas defined by strokes can be painted by using the styles available in the level palette. Toonz Vector levels have an unlimited size and resolution, as they are vector-based. They are saved as PLI files.

Toonz Raster levels are defined by drawing bitmap lines; lines and areas defined by lines can be painted by using the styles available in the level palette. Toonz Raster levels have a specified size and resolution, defined when they are created. They are saved as TLV files.

Raster levels are defined by drawing bitmap lines using the styles available in the **Raster Drawing Palette**, that is shared by all of the Raster levels of the same project (see  :ref:`Project Default Folders <project_default_folders>`  ). Raster levels have a specified size and resolution, defined when they are created. They are saved as sequences of individual TIF files, one per level frame.

When an animation level is defined, you can select any of its frames in the Xsheet/Timeline or in the Level Strip, and start drawing in the viewer. You can do this both, when you want to create a drawing from scratch, and when you want to edit a previously made drawing.

When selected in the Xsheet/Timeline, the viewer displays the whole scene content at the current frame; when selected in the Level Strip, the viewer displays the selected frame of the current animation level only, to let you work more easily on it.


.. _setting_the_default_type_of_level_to_draw:

Setting the Default Type of Level to Draw
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
It's possible to define the default level type that will be created when you draw inside OpenToonz.

By default Toonz Vector and Toonz Raster levels are saved in the **+drawing** folder of the current project when the scene is saved, while Raster levels are saved in the **+extras** folder (see  :ref:`Project Default Folders <project_default_folders>`  ).

.. tip:: **To define the Default Type of Level to Draw:**

    1. Open File  →  Preferences...  →  Drawing.

    2. Choose the level type you want to use as default from the **Default Level Type:** option menu. **Width**, **Height** and **DPI** fields are available for **Toonz Raster Level** and **Raster Level** options.

.. note:: The Width, Height and DPI values set in the File  →  Preferences...  →  Drawing section will also be used as default for the **New Level** dialog.


Drawing Animation Levels
''''''''''''''''''''''''
Animation levels can be created in the following ways:

- Using the **New Level** dialog.

- Setting the Autocreation option to **Enabled**.

- Setting the Autocreation option to **Use Xsheet as Animation Sheet**.


.. _using_the_new_level_dialog:

Using the New Level Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New animation levels can be defined by using a dialog that lets you set the number of drawings the level is made of, the animation step used to expose the frames in the Xsheet/Timeline, and the increment, that sets the way the level drawings are numbered. For example, a **Step** 2 repeats each drawing twice in the Xsheet column or Timeline layer, while an **Increment** 2 will number its drawings as 1, 3, 5, etc. The dialog also allows you to choose a destination folder, different from the default one, by using the **Save In** field.

In case you define a Toonz Raster or a Raster level, you can set its **Width**, **Height** and **DPI** values, according to the way you want to use it in the scene.

Settings like the length of the level and the numbering order can be edited later, as you are free to arrange the images composing an animation level the way you prefer (see  :ref:`Editing Animation Levels <editing_animation_levels>`  ).

When a new level is created in an empty column, the color of that column header and the cells where the new level gets exposed are colored denoting the type of level: **light yellow** for Toonz Vector levels, **light green** for Toonz Raster levels, and **light blue** for Raster levels (see  :ref:`Working with Xsheet Columns <working_with_xsheet_columns>`  ). 

.. note:: The New Level dialog inherits the **Default Level Type** settings defined in Preferences...  →  Drawing.

.. tip:: **To create a new animation level to draw:**

    1. Do one of the following:

    - Select a cell in the Xsheet/Timeline where you want to place your animation level and choose Level → New  →  **New Level...**

    - Right-click the cell in the Xsheet/Timeline where you want to place your animation level and choose **New Level...** from the menu that opens.

    - (If the Xsheet/Timeline toolbar is visible) Click any of the three **New Level buttons** at the leftmost part of it.

    2. Choose the type of level: Toonz Vector, Toonz Raster or Raster, from the **Type:** option menu and define its settings, then click the OK button.

    .. note:: When using the Xsheet/Timeline's toolbar buttons to create a new level, the corresponding level type is already preselected in the dialog's dropdown menu.

    .. note:: If a level is already exposed in the cell column, the new level will be created in an empty column.

.. tip:: **To define the saving location for the level you want to draw:**

    In the **New Level** dialog type in the **Save In:** field, or use the **Browser button**, to set the path for the saving location.

    .. note:: If in the browser you choose any project folder, in the path field the full path will be replaced by the correspondent *folder alias* (see  :ref:`Project Default Folders <project_default_folders>`  ).


.. _using_the_autocreation_option:

Using the Autocreation Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When in Preferences  →  Drawing the **Autocreation:** option is set to **Enabled**, it is possible to create new drawings automatically by using drawing tools in the viewer. If the currently selected cell is empty, a new level will be automatically created and named with the first available letter of the alphabet; if the currently selected cell is the one **right after** one containing a level drawing (either in the Xsheet/Timeline or the Level Strip) a new drawing will be added to that level.

.. note:: The level type will be the one defined in Preferences...  →  Drawing as **Default Level Type**.


.. _using_the_xsheet_as_animation_sheet:

Using the Xsheet as Animation Sheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When in Preferences...  →  Drawing the **Autocreation:** option is set to **Use the Xsheet as Animation Sheet**, it's possible to create new drawings automatically by using drawing tools in the viewer. If the currently selected cell is empty and belongs to an empty column, a new level will be automatically created and named with the first available letter of the alphabet; if the currently selected cell is **anywhere after** one containing a level drawing, a new drawing will be added to that level. In both cases the drawings will take its number from the scene current frame ; if that drawing number already existed in the level, a letter will be added to its number (e.g. A.0001a.ext). 

This working method allows you to work as a traditional animator: you can start creating the *key drawings*, and then add *breakdown drawings*, and then *inbetween drawings*. You can quickly check your animation flipping it in the viewer.

When you add a new drawing it will be repeated as a *hold* along the column/layer up to the following one.

It's also possible to create a new drawing in a cell that contains a *hold*: the new drawing will replace the hold up to the following drawing. Drawings can also be duplicated creating a copy with a different number.

Once the animation is completed you can renumber the whole sequence according to the Xsheet/Timeline frame numbering.

.. note:: The level type will be the one defined in Preferences...  →  Drawing as **Default Level Type**.

.. tip:: **To create a new animation level**

    Click an empty cell in the Xsheet/Timeline and start drawing using a drawing tool in the viewer.

.. tip:: **To add a drawing to an existing level**

    Click an empty cell in the column/layer containing the existing level and start drawing using a drawing tool in the viewer.

.. tip:: **To automatically renumber the drawings**

    1. Select the cells with the drawings you want to renumber.

    2. Choose the Cells  →  **Autorenumber** command.

     .. note:: The **Autorenumber** command is also available in the menu that opens when right-clicking in a cell.


.. _using_the_work_area:

Using the Viewer
''''''''''''''''
In the viewer, it's possible to use the tools available in the toolbar to draw, paint, edit and model drawings. The work area of the viewer is endless and you can scroll, zoom in, zoom out and rotate it. 

In the title bar you can find information about what is currently displayed and selected, the zoom percentage, and a set of buttons that lets you set the view mode (see  :ref:`Using the Viewer <using_the_viewer>`  ).

At the bottom of the viewer another customizable set of buttons is available. 

The frame bar and the playback buttons let you set the current frame and move through animation frames. The set frame rate is visualized, and, in case the playback is activated, the actual frame rate is displayed on its left. 

The other buttons are relevant only using the Animate tool (|animate|) to animate objects and when previewing the animation in the viewer (see :ref:`Animating Objects <animating_objects>` and :ref:`Previewing the Animation <previewing_the_animation>`  ).

.. note:: If the bottom bar is too short to display all the options, it can be scrolled by using arrow buttons available at its ends.

.. note:: In case a frame range is defined by playback markers, the playback buttons operate on the defined range only (see  :ref:`Using the Playback Markers <using_the_playback_markers>`  ).

.. tip:: **To navigate the work area:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Use the **Zoom** tool (|zoom|): to zoom in, click and drag up; to zoom out, click and drag down. The point where you click is the center of the zooming action.

    - Use the zoom shortcut keys (by default + and - keys) to zoom in and zoom out at specific steps (e.g. 50%, 100%, 200%, etc.).

    - Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and zoom out.

    - Middle-click and drag or use the **Hand** tool (|hand|) to scroll in any direction.

    - Use the **Rotate** tool (|rotate|) to rotate the viewer: an *horizon line* is displayed to let you understand the amount of rotation; the center of rotation is the absolute center of the work area.

    - Use the reset view shortcut (by default the **Alt + 0** key) or right-click in the viewer and select **Reset View** from the menu that opens, to display the viewer at its actual size, centered on the absolute center with no rotation applied.

    - Right-click and choose **Fit to Window** to automatically zoom the viewer so that it fits the camera box.

.. tip:: **To play the scene contents back:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Use the **Play** button.

    - Drag the frame bar cursor.

.. tip:: **To set the current frame:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Use the playback buttons.

    - Drag the frame bar cursor.

    - Type in the **Current Frame** field the number of the frame you want to view.

.. tip:: **To set the playback frame rate:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Enter a value in the **FPS** field.

    - Use the frame rate slider.


.. _adjusting_the_work_area_visualization:

Adjusting the Viewer Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The way the viewer visualizes the scene content can be adjusted according to the task to perform.

**Full Screen** mode can be entered to maximize the viewer to the monitor screen, hiding any interface window border. This is available only on the Windows platform.

Vector drawings, that can slow down the visualization performance when used in large amounts in a scene, can be visualized as raster drawings, faster to visualize, still preserving their vector nature, by using the **Visualize Vector As Raster** option.

.. note:: If the current level is vector-based, it will still be displayed as vector to allow any drawing/editing operation you may perform.

Raster drawings and images that usually are displayed in the viewer according to their DPI value, can be displayed at their actual pixel size, that is to say that one pixel from the image is displayed as one pixel of the screen monitor, to better examine them.

.. note:: Visualizing an image at its actual pixel size is different from zooming in because zooming always takes into account the image DPI information.

.. tip:: **Windows only - To enter the viewer full screen mode:**

    Right-click the viewer and choose **Full Screen Mode** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **Windows only - To exit the viewer full screen mode:**

    Right-click the viewer and choose **Exit Full Screen Mode** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To activate or deactivate the raster visualization for vector drawings:**

    Activate or deactivate the View  →  **Visualize Vector As Raster** option.

.. tip:: **To display raster drawings and images at their actual pixel size:**

    1. In the Xsheet/Timeline select the level to which the drawing or image belongs so that it becomes the current level.

    2. Select the drawing or image in the Level Strip in order to display it alone.

    3. Use the Actual Pixel Size shortcut (by default the **N** key) or right-click in the viewer and choose **Actual Pixel Size** from the menu that opens.


.. _customizing_the_work_area:

Customizing the Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Viewer can be customized according to your needs: the background colors visible in the Viewer and inside the camera box can be changed; a Field Guide and a Safe Area can be displayed for reference; the Table and Camera Box can be hidden; Custom Guides can be added to help you in aligning objects or composing the elements of the scene for a particular frame. The View  →  **Inks Only** check allows to hide the painted areas of the levels, facilitating the drawing process.

The set of buttons and information available in the bottom bar of the Viewer can be customized as well, so that only the elements you require are visible.

.. tip:: **To change the Viewer Background color:**

.. tip:: **To show or hide the Rulers where Custom Guide markers are located:**

    Choose View  →  **Rulers** to show or hide the rulers.

  .. note:: When the Viewer work area is rotated, guides are rotated as well, but rulers and guide markers will preserve their position and orientation. However the position of a guide will still be controlled by markers, even if they visually don’t match anymore.

.. tip:: **To customize the set of buttons in the bottom bar of the viewer:**

    Click the option button (|option|) on the far left of the bottom area, and select the elements to show, or deselect those to hide, in the menu that opens. 


.. _drawing_tools:

Drawing Tools
'''''''''''''
You can draw by using the **Brush** (|brush|) and **Geometric** (|geometric|) tools. For both tools you can set the thickness of the line you are going to draw: values range from 0 to 100 for Toonz Vector levels, and from 1 to 100 for Toonz Raster and Raster levels.

.. note:: For Toonz Raster and Raster levels it's possible to set a Brush tool size higher than 100 by typing it in the Size value fields.

.. note:: **Min** and **Max Size/Thickness** can be modified by either of these methods:

    - Pressing **Ctrl + Alt** and moving the mouse. *Moving horizontally* changes the **Max** value, while *moving vertically* changes the **Min** value.
    
    - Using the predefined keyboard shortcuts. **U** and **I** for respectively decreasing and increasing the **Max** value, or **H** and **J** for respectively decreasing and increasing the **Min** value.

With the **Brush** tool (|brush|), you can take full advantage of the pressure sensitivity if you are using a pressure sensitive tablet. The more you press on the tablet, the thicker the line you draw. 

With the **Geometric** tool (|geometric|), the thickness value is constantly applied to the whole shape you draw. 

When creating vector drawings the size/thickness can also be set to 0 (zero): in this case vector strokes will only exist as a wireframe even if you zoom in or zoom out, and they will be not visible when the animation is rendered.

.. note:: For vector drawings, line thickness can be changed and tweaked afterwards by using other tools (see  :ref:`Editing Drawings <editing_drawings>`  ).


.. _drawing_with_the_brush_tool:

Drawing with the Brush Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **Brush** tool (|brush|) allows you to draw freehand lines with the current style. 

When using a pressure sensitive tablet, and the **Pressure** option is activated, varying the pressure of the pen on the tablet will allow you to create variable-thickness lines that will make your drawings more expressive. 

When using the **Brush** tool (|brush|) on Toonz Raster and Raster drawings, the cursor displays the exact pixel area that will be affected by the brush: the inner jagged circle representing the **Minimum Size**, and the outer one the **Maximum Size** of the brush.

In the tool options bar you can set the following:

- **Size Min** and **Max** sets the size of the brush; the size will vary between the two values if you're using a pressure sensitive tablet. If the two values are the same, your lines will have a constant thickness. When using a mouse to draw, the **Maximum** thickness value will be used.

- **Accuracy** sets how accurate the generated line is compared to what you draw with the mouse or tablet pen: a high value will generate lines that completely preserves the movement you perform (even a trembling hand); a low value will simplify the line. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Smooth** allows for stroke stabilization while drawing. This is available for Toonz Vector and Toonz Raster drawings only.

- **Hardness** sets the amount of antialiasing along the line border. This is available for Toonz Raster and Raster drawings only.

- **Opacity Min** and **Max** sets the opacity of the brush; the opacity will vary between the two values if you're using a pressure sensitive tablet. Overlapping areas are not considered while drawing a single line, but only when different lines are overlapping. This is available for Raster drawings only.

- **Break** automatically breaks the drawn stroke into sections, if very sharp angles are drawn: in this way, drawn shapes may result simpler and easier to fill. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Draw Order** allows to choose how new drawings will be ordered with respect to already drawn lines. The options are: **Over All**, **Under All** and **Palette Order**. When using **Palette Order** new lines will be drawn above or below already existing ones, using the relative indexes of the palette Styles as the sorting factor. This is available for Toonz Raster drawings only.

- **Pencil** mode draws lines without antialiasing, that is with jagged edges. This is available for Toonz Raster drawings only.

- **Pressure** detects, in case you are using a graphic tablet, the pressure of the pen on the tablet, allowing the creation of variable-thickness lines.

- **Range** allows for the automatic creation of a series of in-between strokes, by drawing just the extremes of the animation on subsequent frames of a level, in the Level Strip, or subsequent exposed cells of a level in the Xsheet/Timeline. By pressing **Ctrl** key, you can draw intermediate strokes to form a more complex animation sequence. This method is similar to the one used by the **Inbetween** command (see  :ref:`Using the In-betweener with Vector Drawings <using_the_in-betweener_with_vector_drawings>`  ). This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Snap** allows for the snapping of the cursor to other already drawn strokes of the same level, while drawing a new stroke. It has three levels of sensitivity: **Low**, **Med** and **High**. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Preset:** let you choose a brush preset in the option menu on the right. You can add or remove a preset clicking the **+** and **-** buttons. A presets list is created *for each level type* and each added preset will be available for next use.

- **Cap** option sets the shape of the ends of the stroke you are going to draw. Options are **Butt** for squared ends, **Round** for semicircular ends, and **Projecting** for squared ends extending beyond the end of the line, according to the vector thickness. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Join** option sets the shape of the straight corners along the stroke you are going to draw. Options are **Miter** for pointed corners, **Round** for rounded corners, **Bevel** for squared corner. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Miter:** sets the maximum length of a miter join, that is computed multiplying the miter value by the stroke thickness. If the length exceeds the maximum value, the *Miter* join is turned into a *Bevel* join. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only, and only if the **Join** option is set to miter.

.. note:: If the tool options bar is too short to display all the tool options, it can be scrolled by using arrow buttons available at its ends.

.. tip:: **To add a new brush preset:**

    1. Click the **+** button on the right of the presets list.

.. tip:: **To remove a new brush preset:**

    1. Click the **-** button on the right of the presets list.


.. _drawing_with_the_geometric_tool:

Drawing with the Geometric Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **Geometric** tool (|geometric|) allows you to draw rectangles, circles, ellipses, regular polygons, polylines and arcs. 

In the tool options bar you can set the following:

- **Thickness** sets the size of the brush used to draw the geometric shapes.

- **Hardness** sets the amount of antialiasing along the shape border. This is available for Toonz Raster and Raster drawings only.

- **Opacity** sets the opacity of the shape border. Overlapping areas are not considered while drawing over the same shape, but only when different shapes are overlapping. This is available for Raster drawings only.

- **Shape:** sets the type of shape you want to draw. Available options are: Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Polyline, Arc and Polygon. In case you want to draw a **Polygon**, the **Polygon Sides:** lets you set the number of sides.

- **Auto Group** automatically defines any drawn closed shape (i.e. rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons and closed polylines) as a group, *thus creating a new layer that is placed in front of the other drawing vectors*, without intersecting them (see  :ref:`Grouping and Ungrouping Vectors <grouping_and_ungrouping_vectors>`  ). This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Auto Fill** automatically paints the area defined by any drawn closed shape (i.e. rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons and closed polylines) with the same style used for drawing. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Snap** allows for the snapping of the cursor to other already drawn strokes of the same level, while drawing the shape. It has three levels of sensitivity: **Low**, **Med** and **High**. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Selective** allows the drawing operations not to affect already drawn lines. This is available for Toonz Raster drawings only.

- **Pencil** mode draws geometric shapes without antialiasing, that is with jagged edges. This is available for Toonz Raster drawings only.

- **Cap** option sets the shape of the ends of open shapes you are going to draw. Options are **Butt** for squared ends, **Round** for semicircular ends, and **Projecting** for squared ends extending beyond the end of the line, according to the vector thickness. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Join** option sets the shape of the straight corners along the shapes you are going to draw. Options are **Miter** for pointed corners, **Round** for rounded corners, **Bevel** for squared corner. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Miter:** sets the maximum length of a miter join, that is computed multiplying the miter value by the stroke thickness. If the length exceeds the maximum value, the *Miter* join is turned into a *Bevel* join. This is available for Toonz Vector levels only, and only if the **Join** option is set to **Miter**.

.. note:: If the tool options bar is too short to display all the tool options, it can be scrolled by using arrow buttons available at its ends.

While **Rectangles** and **Ellipses** are defined by a (bounding) box, **Circles** and **Polygons** are defined by a center and radius; **Polylines** can be used to create open or closed shapes by defining a series of lines; **Arcs** let you set the end points of a curve, and then the bend.

.. tip:: **To draw a rectangle or an ellipse:**

    Click to define the upper left corner, drag, and release to define the bottom right corner. If you press the **Shift** key while dragging, the shape will be regular, i.e. a square or a circle; if you press the **Alt** key, shapes will be drawn starting from their center. It's possible to press both keys at the same time.

.. tip:: **To draw a circle:**

    Click to define the center, drag and release to define the radius.

.. tip:: **To draw a polygon:**

    1. Set the number of sides in the **Polygon Sides:** field.

    2. Click to define the center, drag and release to define the radius of a circle bounding the polygon.

.. tip:: **To draw a polyline:**

    1. Do one of the following:

    - **Click** to define the first point as a corner point.

    - **Click and drag** to define the first point as a control point; while dragging you can set the control point handles.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - **Click** to define the end point of the line as a corner point. If you press the **Shift** key, you will draw a vertical, horizontal or 45° line.

    - **Click and drag** to define the end point of the line as a control point; while dragging you can set the control point handles.

    3. Do one of the following:

    - **Click** or **click and drag** again to define the end point of another line connected to the end point of the previous line.

    - **Double click** to define the last point of an open shape. 

    - **Click** or **click and drag** again on the first point you defined to draw a closed shape.

     .. note:: Press the **Ctrl** key to add a linear point after a Nonlinear one.

     .. note:: Press the **ESC** key to cancel the creation of the polyline.

.. tip:: **To draw an arc:**

    1. Click to define the first end point.

    2. Click to define the second endpoint.

    3. Drag to set the bend, and click to draw the arc.


.. _adding_text:

Adding Text
~~~~~~~~~~~
Text can be added by using the **Type** tool (|type|). 

.. note:: It is also possible to work with editable and animatable text in OpenToonz through the use of the **Text Iwa** effect. For more information, please see  :ref:`Text Iwa <text_iwa>`  .

In the tool options bar you can set the following:

 - **Font:** to be used, taken from a list based on the Operating System default fonts folder. 

 - **Style:**, for the chosen font. 

 - **Size:**, for the chosen font. 

  .. note:: Already written text can be resized by using the **Selection** tool (|selection|) (see  :ref:`Editing Drawings <editing_drawings>`  ).

 - **Vertical Orientation**, lets you place the text vertically, one letter under another, instead of horizontally.

The *current* palette Style is applied to the text you type. The palette style can be changed while typing text, thus you can have characters with different styles in the same text editing session (see  :ref:`Editing Styles <editing_styles>`  ).

.. note:: For vector levels, as soon as the text is committed, it's converted into vector outlines, and can no longer be edited as text.

.. tip:: **To add text:**

    1. Select the **Type** tool (|type|) and click in the viewer where you want to start writing. 

    2. Choose options **Font**, **Style**, **Size** and **Vertical Orientation**. These options can be changed as long as you are in text editing mode.

    3. Change the current color Style in the palette, if you want to use more than one style in the same text editing session.

    4. Click inside the text editing area to change the text insertion point.

    5. Click outside the text editing area, or select a different tool, to commit the text.


.. _using_the_eraser:

Using the Eraser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **Eraser** tool (|eraser|) allows you to partially erase lines, both in vector and raster drawings. 

In the tool options bar you can set the following:

- **Size** sets the eraser size.

- **Hardness** sets the amount of antialiasing along the eraser border. This is available for Toonz Raster and Raster drawings only.

- **Opacity** set the opacity of the eraser; passing twice on an area is not considered while performing a single erasing operation, but only when performing different erasing operations. This is available for Raster drawings only.

- **Type:** has the options **Normal**, to use the standard eraser; **Rectangular**, to perform the erasing inside the box you define; **Freehand**, to perform the erasing inside the area you outline by clicking and dragging; and **Polyline**, to perform the erasing inside the area you outline by defining a series of lines. In vector drawings, a stroke is erased only if it is fully included in the area you define.

- **Mode:** has the options **Areas**, to erase only areas, **Lines**, to erase only the drawing outline, and **Lines & Areas**, to perform both the operations. This is available only for Toonz Raster drawings.

- **Selective** allows you to erase only lines or areas made with the current style. This is available only for Toonz Vector and Toonz Raster drawings.

- **Invert** performs the erasing on the outside of the area defined with the Rectangular, Freehand or Polyline options. In vector drawings, a stroke is erased only if it is fully outside of the area you define.

- **Frame Range** allows you to perform Rectangular, Freehand and Polyline erasing on a range of frames, by defining an area in the first and then in the last frame of the range.

- **Pencil** mode erases lines without antialiasing, that is with jagged edges. This is available for Toonz Raster drawings only.

.. note:: If the tool options bar is too short to display all the tool options, it can be scrolled by using arrow buttons available at its ends.

.. note:: The **Eraser** tool (|eraser|) can be automatically selected by *using the eraser of the tablet pen*.


.. _converting_raster_drawings_to_vectors:

Converting Raster Drawings to Vectors
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Scanned drawings and raster ones, i.e. drawings not based on vectors, can be converted into Toonz Vector levels.

Two main conversion modes are available: **Centerline** and **Outline**. The choice between the two modes depends on which conversion best fits your needs.

In **Centerline** mode a *single vector stroke with a variable thickness* is generated for each line in the drawing. This means that the converted drawing can be edited like vector-based drawings made directly in OpenToonz, for example you can change the bend of a stroke with the **Pinch** (|pinch|) or **Control Point Editor** tools, and the thickness with the **Pump** tool (|pump|).

In **Outline** mode *two vector strokes* are generated to define each line in the drawing, and areas filled with different colors are separated by a stroke. This means that, for example, to change the bend of a line you have to change the bend of the two strokes defining it, and to change the thickness you have to model one or both strokes defining it. *The thickness of all the strokes is set to 0, so that they won’t be visible in the final render*.

.. note:: Parameters that are not considered necessary by the user can be hidden using the **Options** button (|option|) at the bottom right of the **Convert To vector Pop Up**.


In **Outline** mode the following settings are available:

- **Accuracy** sets how much the vector strokes will follow the shape of the original drawing lines. High values create more precise strokes, but makes them more complex.

- **Despeckling** removes small spots or marks from the converted images. Its value expresses the size in pixels of the maximum area that has to be removed. 

- **Preserve Painted Areas**, when activated, includes all the colors in the converted level. 

- **Adherence** sets how much smooth curves bend toward full corners.

- **Angle** sets the angular threshold below which full corners are inserted in the image

- **Curve Radius** sets the measure of a curve's radius below which it is replaced by a smooth corner

- **Max Colors** defines the maximum number of colors that are considered in the Raster image and used in the vector one. The value has to be set taking care of the real number of colors used in the Raster image. High values increase the time needed for the conversion. This is relevant for Raster levels only.

- **Transparent Color** defines the color that has to be set as the transparent background of the resulting vector level. This is relevant for Raster levels only.

- **Tone Threshold** sets the value of the darkest pixels to be taken into account to detect lines to be converted to vector; for low values only the darkest pixels are considered thus resulting in thinner lines; for high values lighter pixels are considered too, thus resulting in thicker lines. This is relevant for Toonz Raster levels only.


In **Centerline** mode the following settings are available:

- **Threshold** sets the value of the darkest pixels to be taken into account to detect lines to be converted to vector strokes; for low values only the darkest pixels are considered thus resulting in thinner strokes; for high values lighter pixels are considered too, thus resulting in thicker strokes. For Toonz Raster levels (TLV files) the process examines only pixels belonging to the lines; for Raster levels it examines pixels of the whole image.

- **Accuracy** sets how much the vector stroke will follow the shape of the original drawing lines. High values create more precise strokes but makes them more complex.

- **Despeckling** ignores during the conversion small areas generated by the image noise; the higher the value, the larger the areas ignored.

- **Max Thickness** sets the maximum vector stroke thickness; if this value is low very thick lines will be converted in two centerline strokes defining the line outline; if this value is high, they will be converted in a single centerline stroke.

- **Thickness Calibration Start:** and **End:** calibrates the vector stroke thickness defined according to the **Threshold** value; a low value will reduce the stroke thickness preserving its integrity. A different value inserted in the **Start** / **End** field determines an animation of the thickness along the length of the level.

- **Preserve Painted Areas**, when activated, preserves all painted areas in Toonz Raster levels (TLV files) and all the areas painted with colors different from the line color in Raster levels.

- **Add Border** adds a vector stroke along the image border in order to detect also areas bleeding off the image edge.

- **Enhanced ink recognition**, when activated, allows to vectorize Raster images (such as TGA, TIF, PNG etc...) without antialiasing along the lines. An heuristic is used to recognize lines and painted areas creating a PLI level, where the lines are seen as ink and the painted areas as paint.

It's possible to select the images or the level frames that have to be converted directly in the Xsheet/Timeline.

When a conversion is performed, a new level is created according to the selection you made, and exposed in the Xsheet/Timeline in the next column/layer to that containing the source level. The new file will have the same name of the starting one, but with a PLI extension, and a “v” suffix, and is saved in the **+drawings** default folder. 

.. note:: In case a PLI level with the same name already exists, the name of the new file will be followed by a progressive number.

.. tip:: **To convert raster drawings into vectors:**

    1. Select the level frames to convert in the Xsheet/Timeline.

    2. Choose Level → Convert  →  **Convert to Vectors...**

    3. In the dialog set parameters for the conversion.

.. _editing_drawings:

Editing Drawings
----------------
Toonz Vector, Toonz Raster and Raster levels, can be manipulated in OpenToonz.

To edit a drawing, for example to copy a part of it, you have first to select it in the Xsheet/Timeline or in the Level Strip. When selected in the Xsheet/Timeline, the viewer displays the whole scene contents at the current frame, when selected in the Level Strip, the viewer displays the selected frame of the current animation level only, to let you work more easily on it.

Drawings can be also selected directly in the viewer: this allows you to work on the different drawings visible at a certain frame with no need to retrieve them in the Xsheet/Timeline or Level Strip.

.. note:: All the editing performed on drawings is not saved until you save the related level, or use the **Save All** command (see  :ref:`Saving Levels <saving_levels>`  ).

.. tip:: **To select the drawing to edit:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Select it in the Xsheet/Timeline or Level Strip.

    - Right-click in the viewer the drawing you want to edit and in the menu that opens choose the **Select** command related to the column containing the drawing you want to edit.

    .. note:: The right-click menu first lists all the columns containing overlapping drawings, then the columns and objects that are hierarchically linked to the clicked one.


.. _using_the_selection_tool:

Using the Selection Tool
''''''''''''''''''''''''
The **Selection** tool (|selection|) allows you to edit, move, rotate, scale and distort a selection in a drawing. 

In the tool options bar you can set the following:

- **Type:** has the options **Rectangular**, to select the area of the box you define by clicking and dragging; **Freehand**, to select the area you outline by clicking and dragging; and **Polyline**, to select the area you outline by defining a series of lines. In vector drawings, a vector stroke is selected only if it is fully included in the area you define.

- **Preserve Thickness** will preserve the original thickness of the drawing vectors while performing resizing operations. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Scale H** and **V** set the horizontal and vertical scaling of the current selection.

- **Link** will maintain the proportion of the selection while draging over any of the Scale **H** or **V** letters in the tool options bar.

- **Rotation** sets the rotation of the current selection.

- **Position X** and **Y** set a vertical and horizontal offset for the selection.

- **Thickness** sets the thickness of the selected vector strokes. In case the selected strokes have variable thickness, or different thickness values, the highest value is displayed, and any change will affect the other values accordingly. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

- **Cap:** sets the shape of the ends of the selected vector strokes. Options are **Butt** for squared ends, **Round** for semicircular ends, and **Projecting** for squared ends extending beyond the end of the line, according to the stroke thickness. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

  .. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/caps.png

     A butt cap, a round cap and a projecting cap.

- **Join:** sets the shape of the straight corners along the selected vector strokes. Options are **Miter** for pointed corners, **Round** for rounded corners, **Bevel** for squared corner. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only.

  .. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/joins.png

     Miter joins, round joins and bevel joins.

- **Miter:** sets the maximum length of a *Miter* join, that is computed multiplying the Miter value by the stroke thickness. If the length exceeds the maximum value, the *Miter* join is turned into a *Bevel* join. This is available for Toonz Vector drawings only, and only if the **Join:** option is set to **Miter**.

- **Modify Savebox** check box allows you to resize the *Savebox* of a drawing. The drawing part that, because of the editing, falls outside of the savebox will be erased. This is available for Toonz Raster drawings only.

  .. note:: The *Savebox* size can be set automatically to the minimum size by activating the Preferences  →  Drawing  →  **Minimize Savebox after Editing** option.

- **No Antialiasing** when activated, the antialiasing is not applied when the selection is deformed or rotated. This is available on Toonz Raster and Raster drawings only.

.. _grouping_and_ungrouping_vectors:

Grouping and Ungrouping Vectors
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
All the vector strokes of a drawing lie on the same plane, therefore drawing *areas* are outlined by segments defined by strokes intersections. This means that if you draw two intersecting squares, automatically three areas are defined: one belonging only to the first square, one to the second one, and another defined by the intersection.

.. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/grouping_problem.png

   Painting a drawing that contains intersecting vector strokes and shapes may be an issue, because all of them lie on the same layer.

To organize strokes you can use the grouping features, that creates a new group entity containing only the strokes you select.

In the case of two intersecting squares, if you want the two squares to be overlapping instead of intersecting, you can create a group containing the strokes of the first square, and another those of the second square, thus defining two groups whose order can be arranged.

It's possible to create as many groups as you want in any drawing; groups can be made of one stroke only as well, for instance a circle, or a line.

.. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/grouping_solution.png

   First define groups, then set a proper layering order to solve the intersection problems.

When drawing with the **Geometric** tool (|geometric|), closed shapes (i.e. rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons and closed polylines) can be defined automatically as a group by activating the **Auto Group** option (see :ref:`Drawing with the Geometric Tool <drawing_with_the_geometric_tool>`  ). 

When your strokes selection includes one or several groups, the new group will include them as well, preserving them and their original sorting order position in case the group is released. 

.. note:: It's not possible to define a group if the selection includes only some strokes belonging to a group.

When a group is released, if no other group is defined in the same drawing, all the strokes will lie at the same plane; if other groups are defined, the strokes of the released group will lie on a plane behind, in front of, or between the other groups, according to the original group sorting order position.

It's possible to enter groups to isolate them visually from the rest of the drawing and better understand which strokes are inside and which outside the group. In this way it's also easier to work on the drawing, for instance to fill an area or to change the color of some strokes. 

As the **Selection** tool (|selection|) considers the group as a whole, if you want to select a stroke belonging to a group, first you have to enter the group, and then select the stroke.

.. note:: As groups define which strokes belong to a certain plane, when using the **Fill** tool (|fill|), only areas defined by strokes within the same group can be filled.

.. tip:: **To Define a group:**

    1. Use the **Selection** tool (|selection|) to select the strokes you want to be in a group.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - Choose Edit → Group  →  **Group**.

    - Right-click on the selection and choose **Group** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To Release a group:**

    1. Select the group you want to release.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - Choose Edit → Group  →  **Ungroup**.

    - Right-click on the selection and choose **Ungroup** from the menu that opens.

    - Set the type to **Rectangular** and click and drag to define a box and select at least one stroke belonging to the group.

    - Set the type to **Freehand** and click and drag to outline an area and select at least one stroke belonging to the group.

    - Set the type to **Polyline** and click to outline an area by defining a series of lines and select at least one stroke belonging to the group.

.. tip:: **To Select a stroke in a group:**

    1. Enter the group.

    2. Click the stroke to select it.


.. _setting_stroke_and_group_layering_order:

Setting Stroke and Group Sorting Order
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

    - Right-click on the selection and choose **Send Backward** from the menu that opens.


.. _editing_vector_drawings:

Editing Vector Drawings
'''''''''''''''''''''''
Vector drawings can be edited in some additional ways by using the set of tools. This allows you for example to better calibrate the bend of a vector, or to change its thickness.

All these transformations can be also achieved on already painted drawings, because the fill styles used to paint will automatically follow the shape of the areas you modify, working like “liquid” color, flooding an area defined by an outline.


.. _editing_vector_control_points:

Editing Vector Control Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a vector by editing its control points you can use the **Control Point Editor** tool (|cpe|). 

Control points have handles whose length and direction define the bend of the vector. With this tool you can select a vector and modify the control point handles, or the bend of a curve defined by control points, and move, add or delete control points.

Control point handles may be linked, that is to say they share the same direction, or not, creating a cusp in the vector; they can also be collapsed in the control point in order to turn it in a corner point. In case only one handle is collapsed, the point will be corner on one side and smooth on the other. When a section of the vector is defined by two corner points, it will be a straight line.

The option Auto Select Drawing is available to automatically select any vector of any drawing visible in the viewer.

.. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/edit_control_points.png

   Click to select a vector stroke and edit its control points; Alt-click to unlink control point handles; Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) the selected stroke to add a control point.

.. tip:: **To select a vector:**

    Click it.

.. tip:: **To edit the bend of a vector:**

    Do any of the following:

.. _changing_the_bend_of_vectors:

Changing the Bend of Vector Strokes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a bend of a vector stroke in a more intuitive way you can use the **Pinch** tool (|pinch|). You can use it anywhere you want on the stroke, in order to modify the bend in any direction. 

When the tool is selected, a segment of the center line of the closest stroke is highlighted: the segment shows the length of the stroke that will be affected by the pinching. 

The length of the segment depends on the corner points, that the tool automatically detects along the stroke, according to the **Corner** value. It can also be manually set by activating the **Manual** option, and thus using the **Size** value to set the affected length.

When the **Manual** mode is activated, a handle is displayed along the highlighted stroke to control interactively the length of the segment that will be affected by the tool. The handle has a double circle and a square at its ends, that allows you to do the following:

- **Double circle** lets you move the handle along the segment.

- **Square** lets you increase the length of the segment affected by the tool by *clicking and dragging right*, or decrease it by *clicking and dragging left*.

In both Automatic and Manual modes, different types of editing can be performed when clicking and moving the cursor:

- **Click** and drag to change the bend of the highlighted segment.

- **Shift-click** and drag to edit the highlighted segment by adding a *cusp*.

- **Ctrl-click** (Pc) or **Cmd-click** (Mac) and drag to edit the highlighted segment by adding a *corner*.

.. tip:: **To modify the bend of a stroke:**

    1. Change the length of the segment affected by the tool by setting the **Corner** value in the tool options bar.

    2. Click, Shift-click, or Ctrl-click (Pc) or Cmd-click (Mac) and drag to modify the bend of the highlighted segment.

.. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/pinch_example.png

   Click and drag to change the bend; Shift-click to add a cusp; Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) to add a corner.

.. tip:: **To modify the bend of a stroke in manual mode:**

    1. Activate the **Manual** option in the tool options bar.

    2. Change the length of the segment affected by the tool by doing one of the following:

    - Set the **Size** value in the tool options bar.

    - Click and drag the small square at one end of the handle displayed along the highlighted stroke.

    3. Click, Shift-click, or Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) and drag to modify the bend of the highlighted segment.

.. tip:: **To eliminate a corner point from a segment:**

    1. Click and drag the point until the smooth segment is formed again.

    2. Click and drag to correct the bend of the newly smoothed segment.


.. _using_other_modifier_tools:

Using Other Modifier Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify the thickness of a stroke you can use the **Pump** tool (|pump|). You can use it anywhere you want on the stroke to increase or decrease the thickness locally. When the tool is selected, a segment of the closest stroke is highlighted: the segment shows the length of the stroke that will be affected by the tool. To modify this length you can change the **Size** value in the tool options bar.

.. note:: It's possible to modify the thickness of a stroke, a stroke selection, or strokes in all of the level drawings, by using the **Selection** tool (|selection|) and its related options (see :ref:`Using the Selection Tool <using_the_selection_tool>`  ).

To distort more than one stroke at once, you can use the **Magnet** tool (|magnet|). The tool affects all stroke included in a circular area and allows you to distort them in the direction of your dragging. Highlighted segments will show the strokes that will be affected. To modify the action range of the tool, represented by a circle, you can change the tool size in the tool options bar.

To bend a part of a drawing, for example a character’s arm, you can use the **Bender** tool (|bender|). The tool allows you to define a line and then bend all the strokes intersected by the segment. While bending you can see the affected strokes assuming their position after the transformation. The bending can be performed in both clockwise and counterclockwise direction; once you start dragging you cannot change the bend direction.

.. note:: If you move the cursor far from the bending center, you will be able to set with more precision the amount of bend you want to apply to the strokes.

To smooth a stroke, you can use the **Iron** tool (|iron|). When used again and again on the same stroke, it increasingly flatten the bends of the stroke. When the tool is selected, the cursor snaps to the closest stroke to indicate where you are going to operate. 

.. tip:: **To modify the thickness of a stroke:**

    1. Select the **Pump** tool (|pump|).

    2. Set the **Size:** value in the tool options bar.

    3. Click the point of the stroke where you want to modify the thickness and drag up to increase it, or down to decrease it. 
    
    .. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/pump_example.png

       Using the Pump tool to change the thickness of drawn strokes.

.. tip:: **To distort several strokes at once:**

    1. Select the **Magnet** tool (|magnet|).

    2. Click in the Viewer: all the strokes included in the circle will be affected by the tool. 

    3. Drag to distort the strokes in the direction of your dragging. 

.. tip:: **To bend one or several strokes:**

    1. Select the **Bender** tool (|bender|).

    2. Click on one side of the strokes you want to bend to set the center of the bend.

    3. Click on the opposite side of the strokes: all strokes intersected by the defined line will be affected by the bending. 

    4. Drag in the direction you want to bend strokes. 

.. tip:: **To smooth a stroke:**

    1. Select the **Iron** tool (|iron|).

    2. Click and drag along the stroke you want to smooth. By dragging over and over the stroke will increasingly flatten.


.. _joining_and_splitting:

Joining and Splitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To join the ends of two different vector strokes, you can use the **Tape** tool (|tape|). This way it will be possible to handle them as a single stroke, for instance for modifying their bend, or thickness, as a whole. 

When the tool is used, the pointer snaps to the closest detected stroke endpoint in order to make the operation easier.

.. note:: The **Tape** tool (|tape|) can also be used to close gaps along the drawing outline for painting purposes (see :ref:`Closing Gaps in Drawing Outline <closing_gaps_in_drawing_outline>`  ).

To do the contrary, that is to say splitting a stroke in two sections, you can use the **Cutter** tool (|cutter|). 

.. tip:: **To join two open ends of one or two strokes:**

    1. Select the **Tape** tool (|tape|), and activate the **Join Vectors** option; activate also the **Smooth** option if you want a smooth joining with no corners.

    2. Do one of the following: 

    - Set the type to **Normal** and the mode to **Endpoint to Endpoint**, click a stroke endpoint and drag to a different endpoint; the pointer snaps to the closest detected stroke endpoint.

    - Set the type to **Rectangular**, and click and drag to define a box including the endpoints you want to connect; the endpoints will be automatically joined according to the set **Distance** value. 

.. note:: If the strokes you are going to join have different Styles, the Style of the first vector where you click on will be assigned to the second one after joining.

.. tip:: **To split a stroke:**

    1. Select the **Cutter** tool (|cutter|): the pointer snaps to the closest stroke indicating, with a small highlighted segment, the point where you are going to split the stroke.

    2. Click to split the stroke at the highlighted point.


.. _cleaning_up_vector_intersections:

Cleaning up Strokes Intersections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vector strokes intersections may be a weak point in drawings to be painted, because if a gap occurs, drawing areas cannot be painted properly.

The best solution for this kind of issue is to overlap the final section of strokes, in order to define clear intersections, then automatically remove the sections that overflow. 

.. tip:: **To cleanup vector intersections:**

    1. Use the **Selection** tool (|selection|) to select the strokes whose intersections you want to cleanup.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - Choose Level → Optimize  →  **Remove Vector Overflow**.

    - Right-click the selection and choose **Remove Vector Overflow** from the menu that opens.


.. _animation_techniques:

Animation Techniques
--------------------
Besides drawing frame by frame, one image at a time, until you achieve the animation you want, some other techniques are easier to achieve thanks to OpenToonz features.

Whatever the technique is, you can control your work and how smooth the animation is by using the onion skin, that allows you to view more than one image in the viewer at the same time as reference.


.. _modelling_a_vector_drawing:

Modelling a Vector Drawing
''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Instead of animating a level by starting every time from a blank frame, you can duplicate a vector drawing and make subsequent modifications. You can do it even if the drawings are painted, because the styles used to paint will automatically follow the shape of the areas you modify (see  :ref:`Editing Drawings <editing_drawings>`  ).

The sequence of the animation level drawings can be easily controlled in the Level Strip.

You can use both the Cells  →  **Duplicate Drawing** command and the standard **Copy** and **Paste** commands to make a copy of a drawing that you can later modify to create slight movements.

When you use the **Duplicate Drawing** command, the selected drawing is duplicated in the following frame. If the following frame already contains a drawing, it's shifted down in order to insert the duplicated drawing in the sequence.

When you use the **Copy** and **Paste** commands, you can also decide the frame of the Level Strip where you want to paste the drawing.

Once finished, you can make a copy of the modified drawing, and modify it in its turn. You can go on duplicating and modifying drawings until you complete the animation level.

.. tip:: **To create an animation level by modelling vector drawings:**

    1. In the Viewer, select a drawing of the vector animation level you want to edit.

    2. In the Level Strip, select the drawing you want to duplicate.

    3. Copy the selected drawing in the following frame by doing one of the following:

    - Choose Cells  →  **Duplicate Drawing**.

    - Choose Edit  →  **Copy**, then select the following frame and choose **Paste**.

    4. Select the new drawing in the Level Strip.

    5. Use modifier tools to modify the drawing.

    6. Go on duplicating and modifying drawings until you complete the animation level.


.. _using_the_in-betweener_with_vector_drawings:

Using the In-betweener with Vector Drawings
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
An animation technique reserved to vector animation levels is the use of the **Inbetween** command. Inbetween creates in-between drawings from the two extremes of a range of selected frames in the Level Strip.

When more than two frames are selected in the Level Strip, a vertical strip labeled **INBETWEEN** is displayed on the right of each frame. By clicking on it, all frames between the first and the last selected, will be overwritten by images interpolating from the first to the last drawings. 

.. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/inbetween.png

   Duplicate a drawing; modify it; insert blank frames; select the frame range, then click the INBETWEEN vertical bar.

The interpolated drawings are created by taking into account the number of the strokes, and the strokes' direction. This means that the result will depend on the way drawings were made. For example if the first image is a single shape drawn clockwise, and the last is another shape, you will get different results depending on the way it was drawn, clockwise or counterclockwise.

To obtain the best results with complex drawings, copy the drawing you want to interpolate from, and paste it in another frame of the level strip. Modify the pasted drawing without adding and deleting strokes, but only distorting and moving existing strokes (see  :ref:`Editing Drawings <editing_drawings>`  ). Select the whole range and then perform the interpolation.

The interpolation acceleration can be controlled in the dialog that opens prior to performing in-betweening. Options are the following:

- **Linear**, for a constant interpolation. 

- **Ease In**, for an interpolation starting slowly, then getting faster. 

- **Ease Out**, for an interpolation starting quickly, then getting slower. 

- **Ease In / Ease Out**, for an interpolation starting slowly, getting faster, then getting slower again.

If you want the interpolation to happen slower or faster, you can insert frames, or cut them, and use the in-betweener again.

.. tip:: **To create in-between drawings:**

    1. Select the level where you want to perform interpolation.

    2. In the Level Strip select the frame range, from the drawing you want to interpolate from, to the one you want to interpolate to. If you want the interpolation to last more frames, make room for more drawings with the Edit  →  **Insert** command.

    3. Click the vertical strip labeled **INBETWEEN** displayed on the right of the frame range selection.

    4. Select the **Interpolation:** mode among **Linear**, **Ease In**, **Ease Out**, **Ease In / Esase Out**, and click the **Inbetween** button.

.. tip:: **To optimize the in-betweening process:**

    1. Create and paint the drawing you want to interpolate from.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - **Copy** and **Paste** it in another frame of the Level Strip, considering the number of in-between drawings you want to achieve.

    - **Duplicate** it and insert as many empty frames as the number of in-between drawings you want to achieve.

    3. Modify the pasted or duplicated drawing using the modifier tools, to create the final drawing of the interpolation.

    4. Select the frame range from the drawing you want to interpolate from, to the one you want to interpolate to.

    5. Click the vertical **INBETWEEN** strip displayed on the right of the frame range selection.


.. _rotoscoping:

Rotoscoping
'''''''''''
Rotoscoping consists of tracing drawings taking a live clip as reference. 

.. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/rotoscoping.png

   Using the rotoscoping technique to trace the movement of a hand.

As you can import clips and image sequences in a scene, you can simply load them, and create an animation level by drawing in the Viewer, while the frames of the clips are visible underneath. See  :ref:`Using the File Browser <using_the_file_browser>`  . 

The way to obtain best results is not trying to reproduce with fidelity the clip, but to use its frames just as a reference to better understand the movement or the transformation of the clip’s subject. In this way you can take advantage, for example, of a natural movement represented in the clip, without renouncing an expressive drawing style.

.. tip:: **To perform rotoscoping:**

    1. Load a video clip or image sequence in an Xsheet column (or Timeline layer).

    2. In the Xsheet/Timeline select a cell in a column on the right of the column (or in a layer on top of the layer) containing the clip you loaded. The image of the clip placed at the same frame of the cell you selected will be visible in the Viewer while you're drawing.

    3. Create a new animation level and use tools to trace the first drawing in the Viewer.

    4. Move to subsequent frames, and trace the next drawings.


.. _cloning_levels:

Cloning Levels
''''''''''''''
Sometimes it may be useful to create a clone of a level, or a part of it, in order to edit it without affecting the original one. For example you may want to create a new animation level starting from the drawings of another level, in order to have two sequences similar but not identical.

The **Clone Cells** command allows you to create an independent copy of the selected cells, preserving the numbering order and assigning a new name to it. The **_clone** suffix appended to the name of the level is the default.

The cloned level will contain *only drawings exposed in the selected cells*, even if the original level is composed of more drawings; they will be automatically exposed in the column on the right (or layer on top) of the selection, shifting the following columns/layers.

The new level will be available in the Scene Cast as a new element; it will be saved in the **+drawings** or **+extras** default folder, according to the format of the original file, as soon as you save it with the **Save Level** command, or you save the scene.

The cell selection can also spread over several columns/layers: in this case the same number of new columns/layers will be inserted to make room for the cloning result. If more than one level is selected, the same number of new levels will be created and it's not possible to assign a name to the cloned levels.

.. tip:: **To clone levels:**

    1. Select the cells you want to clone.

    2. Choose Cells  →  **Clone Cells**.

    3. Enter a **Level Name:** and press **OK** to confirm.


.. _using_onion_skin:

Using Onion Skin
----------------
If you want to view more than one level drawing at the same time in the Viewer as reference when you create drawings, or you want to check the animation, you can activate the Onion Skin mode. 

The Onion Skin is available both in the Xsheet/Timeline and in the Level Strip, according to where the cursor showing the current frame is displayed, as the onion skin can be activated starting from the cursor and managed in the frame number column/bar. 

.. figure:: /_static/drawing_animation_levels/onion_skin.png

   A column animation displayed with the relative Onion Skin set for 6 previous frames, step two, and an absolute Onion Skin set at frame 35.

When a frame of the Level Strip is selected, the onion skin applies to the *current level* only, referring to the sequence of the full animation level as it was created.

When a cell of the Xsheet/Timeline is selected, the onion skin applies to the current level, according to how the drawing sequence is exposed in the scene, including movements and transformations performed thanks to the object animation (see  :ref:`Animating Objects <animating_objects>`  ), while the rest of the scene in the current frame will be visible as usual. If you want, you can also extend the onion skin to the whole content of the Xsheet/Timeline, to allow references to all of the animated or moving elements in the scene as well.

The *relative* Onion Skin mode displays frames in relation to the position of the current frame. For instance you can activate the frame previous to the current one, and every time you change the current frame, the previous frame will be displayed. 

The *fixed* Onion Skin mode displays the selected frame independently from the current frame. For instance you can activate frame 5, and every time you change the current frame, frame 5 will be displayed in Onion Skin mode.

The way images are displayed in Onion Skin mode can be customized in the Preferences... → Onion Skin section. It's possible to define the **Paper Thickness**, to set an independent color correction for previous and following frames, and to **Display Lines Only** for Toonz Vector and Toonz Raster.

.. tip:: **To activate or deactivate frames in Relative Onion Skin mode:**

    Do one of the following:

    - In the Xsheet, click the small romboid markers available to the left of the frames column (or above the frame bar in the Timeline). Click and drag automatically activates or deactivates a series of frames. 

    - In the Level Strip, click the small circular markers available to the left of the strip frames. Click and drag automatically activates or deactivates a series of frames. 

.. tip:: **To activate or deactivate frames in Fixed Onion Skin mode:**

    Do one of the following:

    - In the Xsheet, click the small ghosted romboid markers available to the very left of the frames column (or above the frame bar in the Timeline). Click and drag automatically activates or deactivates a series of frames. 

    - In the Level Strip, click the small ghosted circular markers available to the very left of the strip frames. Click and drag automatically activates or deactivates a series of frames. 

.. tip:: **To Deactivate (or Activate again) the Onion Skin mode:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Double-click over the big circle to the left of the current frame cursor. Double-click again to activate it back.

    - Right-click in the Viewer or in the frames column/bar of the Xsheet/Timeline, and choose **Deactivate Onion Skin** or **Activate Onion Skin** in the menu that opens.

     .. note:: The first time you activate Onion Skin mode by Right-clicking in the Viewer or the Xsheet/Timeline frames column/bar, a default relative onion skin mode activates, showing the previous three frames.

.. tip:: **To Extend the onion skin to the Whole Scene Content:**

    1. Activate the onion skin in the Xsheet/Timeline.

    2. Right-click in the Viewer or in the frame column/bar of the Xsheet/Timeline, and choose **Extend Onion Skin to Scene** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To Limit the onion skin to the Current Level:**

    Right-click in the Viewer or in the frame column/bar of the Xsheet/Timeline, and choose **Limit Onion Skin to Level** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To customize the way images are displayed in onion skin mode:**

    1. Choose File  →  Preferences...  →  **Onion Skin**.

    2. Do any of the following:

    - Set a value for the **Paper Thickness** parameter; the lower the value, the more transparent the drawings displayed in Onion Skin mode will be.

    - Use the **Previous Frames Correction** to set a color for displaying previous frames.

    - Use the **Following Frames Correction** to set a color for displaying following frames.

    - Activate the **Display Lines Only** option to display Toonz Vector or Toonz Raster levels with lines only.


.. _using_the_shift_and_trace:

Using Shift and Trace
---------------------
