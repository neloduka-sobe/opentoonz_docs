.. _creating_movements:

Creating Movements
==================
Each scene has a series of *objects* that can be transformed; they can be Xsheet columns (or Timeline layers), pegbars, cameras, or the table.

Every transformation you set for an object at a specific frame automatically defines a keyframe. When keyframes are defined at several frames, in-between positions are automatically interpolated.

To create more complex animations, you can also work in a 3D environment, where cameras and scene elements can be placed like on a stage at different distances one from another.


.. _using_the_stage_schematic:

Using the Stage Schematic
-------------------------
The Stage Schematic contains *nodes* for all of the objects used in a scene, making it possible to manage the way they are linked to each other. It's organized in a hierarchy starting from the animation table, where all the columns/layers and pegbars are placed. A camera is available as well, and additional cameras can be defined.

|stage_schematic|

By default the Stage Schematic contains the table node and one camera node.

Column/layer nodes are added as soon as you load or create some content; pegbars and cameras can be added at any time (pegbars will be automatically linked to the table).

When more than one camera is created, you can set which is the active one, used in the Viewer; the active camera node is displayed in blue while the others are left idle in grey. Each camera can have a different size and resolution, and each of them can be animated independently (see  :ref:`Defining Camera Settings <defining_camera_settings>`  ).

Objects nodes can be easily added and arranged and they can be selected in order to be cut, copied, pasted or deleted. When selected, nodes' edges are highlighted in white; the current node has its label displayed in yellow; when at least one node is selected, its related links are displayed in cyan.

It's also possible to *group* several nodes into one single node, in order to better manage a complex Stage Schematic. Groups can be opened to be examined, and its components can be selected for further operations, like creating animations or new groups.

.. note:: Column/layer nodes have buttons defining their visibility in Camera stand (|camera_stand|) and Render (|preview|) views, these buttons are located at the top right of the nodes: the toggles are linked to the ones available in the Xsheet columns (Timeline layers) headers (see :ref:`Working with Xsheet Columns <working_with_xsheet_columns>` ).

.. tip:: **To access the stage schematic:**

    - Go to the Window menu, and choose the Schematic option.

    Click the **Reorder Nodes** button (|reorder_nodes|) in the bottom bar of the stage window.


.. _linking_objects:

Linking Objects
---------------
Objects can be linked in order to create shared movements (movements that all the linked objects share with the parent object) and relative movements (movements that are the sum of the object's own movement and the movement of its parent object). 

As parent objects can be linked, in their turn, to other moving objects, it is possible to define a complex hierarchy of transformations.

The hierarchy between objects can be edited by setting links that allow you to set parent and linked objects: columns/layers can be linked to other columns/layers, pegbars, the table or cameras; pegbars can be linked to other pegbars, the table or cameras; cameras can be linked to any object in order to create complex shots, for example with a camera following the movement of a character in the scene.

Links can be set by using the ports located at each side of the object node: 

- The **port on the left** is for linking the object to a **parent** object.

- The **port on the right** is for linking the object to a **child** object.

- The **port at the bottom** is for assigning the object a **motion path** to follow (see for  :ref:`Creating a Movement along a Motion Path <creating_a_movement_along_a_motion_path>` ).

Links can also be selected in order to be deleted: when selected, links are highlighted; when at least one object is selected, the related links are displayed in blue.

Columns/layers and pegbars are always linked, at least to the table: this means that their links cannot be deleted, but only replaced with different ones or restored to their default: the table.

.. tip:: **To link a node to another:**

    In the Stage Schematic, click and drag from a node's left port to the parent node's right port, or viceversa.

.. tip:: **To link a column/layer to another object:**

    Do any of the following:

    - Define the link in the Stage Schematic.

    - Select the **Animate** tool (|animate|) with the **Pick:** option set to **Column**, and in the viewer **Shift-click** the column contents to which you want to link the current column.

.. tip:: **To select the linked object to edit in the hierarchy:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Select it in the Stage Schematic. 

    - Use the **Animate** tool (|animate|) with the **Pick:** option set to **Pegbar** to click a drawing in the viewer and select the first pegbar in the hierarchy the column containing the drawing is linked to.

    - Right-click a drawing in the viewer to choose from the menu that opens the **Select** command related to the object that you want to edit.

.. tip:: **To select links:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Click to select a link.

    - Click and drag to select several links.

    - Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) to add a link to, or remove it from the selection.

    .. note:: Objects can be selected together with links (see  :ref:`Using the Stage Schematic <using_the_stage_schematic>`  ).

.. tip:: **To remove selected links:**

    Choose Edit  →  **Delete**, links will be replaced by default ones (i.e to the table).


.. _advanced_linking:

Advanced Linking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Optionally, the connector ports can be displayed as letters (instead of the default circles), to be able to control, in more advanced ways, the position of the centers to be used when linking the nodes: 

|adv_linking_1|

|adv_linking_2|

    - Center **B** is the geometrical center of each object (and the default connection option).
    - Center **A** is placed 8 inches to the left.
    - Center **C** is placed 8 inches to the right.
    - etc.
    
When a link is created, the letters at its ends set the way the linked object overlaps with the parent object. If at both ends of the link you set the same letter, the two objects will overlap with no offset respect to their default centers; while if for example, a column centered on B is linked to a pegbar centered on A, it will have an offset of 8 inches to the left.

Apart from letters, columns have also numbered centers as well; these serve for setting links relative to the position of Hooks assigned to these columns (see  :ref:`Using Hooks <using_hooks>` ).

    - Center **1** is the center defined by hook number 1.
    - Center **2** is the center defined by hook number 2.
    - etc.

.. note:: While in this mode, each node will have always a free connector port available in order to accept a link to a different center. In this way if you want to link another object to the same parent object, you can choose whether to use the same center or a different one.

.. note:: By defining parent and child objects you can also create cutout animation (see  :ref:`Creating Cutout Animation <creating_cutout_animation>`  ).

.. tip:: **To switch the connector ports display mode:**

    - Click the **Switch Output Port Display Mode** button (|switch_output_port|) in the bottom bar of the Stage Schematic pane until you see the letters on each side of the nodes, instead of the default circles.

.. tip:: **To set the center of an object:**

    1. Place the mouse pointer over the object left port and wait for the double-arrow button to appear.

    2. Click and **drag up or down the double-arrow** button to scroll the options available: letters and numbers for columns, and letters for all the other types of objects.

.. tip:: **To set the way a child object overlaps its parent object:**

    Do any of the following:

    - Set the *same letter* for the two ports at the end of a link to overlap the objects without an offset.

    - Set the *following letter* in alphabetical order on the **left port** of the **child object** to offset it to the left: for each successive letter there is an offset of 8 inches to the left.

    - Set the *following letter* in alphabetical order on the **right port** of the **parent object** to offset it to the right: for each successive letter there is an offset of 8 inches to the right.


.. _using_hooks:

Using Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~
Hooks are reference points that can be defined for any animation level directly in the viewer, by using the **Hook** tool (|hook|).

Once defined for a column/layer, they can be used in the Stage Schematic to link another object to it in relation to a specific hook, or to move it, according to any of its hook sets.

In the first case the hook is used as a tracking point to link another object (a column/layer or camera) to a specific feature of the animation level. For example, if you have a character carrying a lamp, you can track the lamp position with a hook, and link a radial gradient to it (placed over the lamp for every frame of the animation) to create a glow.

In the second case, the hook is used as the center of the column/layer where the hooked level will be exposed, thus creating a different center and offset for each level frame. For example, if you have a walking animation cycle, you can set a new center following the character’s feet with a hook, and make the level move accordingly to prevent a moon-walking effect on the background. 

Hooks can also be split and passed from one drawing feature to another, automatically creating an offset position. For example, the hook following the character’s foot feature can pass from one foot to another, in order to make the character move continuously onward.


.. figure:: /_static/movements/hooks.png

   The hook set 2 follows the lamp, while the hook set 1 follows the character’s feet, passing from one feet to another when both are on the ground.


A hook can be created starting from any frame. Once it is created, it will appear on the following level frames in the same position, from where it can be moved.

You can use up to 20 hooks for each level; each hook is labeled with a number, to reference it in each level frame. 

By activating the **Snap** option, hooks for the current level can be accurately placed by snapping them exactly to the same position of hooks defined for the other animation levels visible in the viewer. In case the current level is a Toonz Vector level, hooks will snap also to the center of any closed shapes it may contain (e.g. rectangles, circles or single vector shapes closed with the Tape tool). This option may prove useful especially when defining hooks for cutout animation models (see  :ref:`Creating Cutout Animation <creating_cutout_animation>`  ).

Hook information is saved along with each level, as a file in XML format, named as the file but with the *_hooks* suffix. For example, hooks defined for the level ``mouse``  will be saved in the file ``mouse_hooks.xml`` .

.. note:: Hooks are also visible in Onion Skin mode (see  :ref:`Using Onion Skin <using_onion_skin>`  ).

.. note:: Hooks can be also used to create a cutout animation model, as they allow you to link the model sections according to specific pivot points (see  :ref:`Creating Cutout Animation <creating_cutout_animation>`  ).

.. tip:: **To define a hook for a level:**

    1. Select a frame from the level you want to set hooks for.

    2. Choose the **Hook** tool (|hook|).

    3. Do one of the following:

    - Click to create a hook and drag to define the hook starting position.

    - Click elsewhere to create another hook and the related hook starting position.

.. tip:: **To select hooks:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Click a hook to select it.

    - Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) to add a hook to, or remove it from the selection.

.. tip:: **To move selected hooks:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Drag them to a new position.

    - **Shift-drag** to constrain an horizontal or vertical movement.

    - Activate the **Snap** option to place the hook exactly at the same position of hooks defined for other animation levels visible in the viewer, or in case the level is a Toonz Vector level, also at the center of closed shapes.

.. tip:: **To pass a hook from one position to another:**

    1. **Alt-click and drag** the hook to split it into two.

    2. Place the **double circle** where the hook has to be for the current frame.

    3. Place the **cross** where you want the reference point to be from the next frame onwards.

.. tip:: **To delete a hook:**

    Select the related hook in any frame and choose Edit  →  **Delete**.

.. tip:: **To link an object to a level hook:**

    1. Link the object to the column containing the hook.

    2. Place the mouse pointer over the column right port and wait for the double-arrow button to appear.

    3. **Click and drag up** the double-arrow button to scroll the numbers available before letter A, and release the mouse button to define the hook number to be used.


    .. figure:: /_static/movements/link_to_hooks.png

       Column 3 is linked to the hook set 2 of column 2, while column 2 is moving according to its own hook set 1.


.. tip:: **To make the level move according to one of its hooks:**

    1. Place the mouse pointer over the left port of the column containing the hook, and wait for the double-arrow button to appear.

    2. **Click and drag up** the double-arrow button to scroll the numbers available before letter A, and release the mouse button to define the hook to be used.

.. tip:: **To prevent an animation walking cycle from moon-walking:**

    Define a hook by following these guidelines:

    - Place the hook on the *same foot feature* along the whole sequence, for example the tip of the foot.

    - If the character is supposed to be moving horizontally on the ground, *the hook should always lie on the ground line* (without changing its vertical position along the sequence). If the feature you are following leaves the ground, still place the hook on the ground line, under the feature you were following.

    - When both feet are on the ground line you can split the hook to pass it form one foot to the other.

    - If the animation is a cycle and you want the character to keep on walking, the last hook position has to be connected to the first one, and the hook has to pass from one foot to the other by splitting it, and then to the first one again by splitting it again. 


.. _tracking_points:

Tracking Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to automatically track specific regions in a sequence of images by using the **Tracker** tool (|tracker|). The results of the tool are a series of hooks that can be used to link an object to another (see above).

|tracking_regions|

When selected, the Tracker tool (|tracker|) allows you to define one or several regions in an image, by defining a center and a size; regions can also be connected to one another to better track points having a visual geometrical relationship. The region defined with the tool sets both, the *pattern* that the tracking system will try to recognize in the following images, and the *size* of the search area where it will look for it (that will be of approximately twice that region).

Once areas to be tracked are defined in the first frame of a range, it's possible to automatically track the regions in a selected range, by specifying the following options:

|tracking_options|

- **Threshold** sets the amount of difference between the defined pattern and the recognized one. When using low values, the tracking system will look for an area with an almost identical pattern, and when using high values, will look for an area that can be quite different from the original one. This means that if the value is too low, it’s more likely for the tracking to fail on certain images; if too high, the tracking may fail by following the wrong areas. 

- **Sensitivity** sets how often the defined pattern has to be updated according to the variation it may have in the following images. For the maximum value, the pattern will be updated after each image is tracked.

- **Variable Region Size**, when activated, will look for the defined pattern considering also the different sizes that it can have in the following images. 

- **Include Background**, when activated, it considers the background as part of the defined pattern. It can be deactivated when tracking an element whose background does not affect the pattern, such as a green/blue screen background.

.. tip:: **To define a region to be tracked:**

    1. Choose the **Tracker** tool (|tracker|) and click and drag in the image.

    2. Use the handles along the defined region bounding box to resize it.

    3. Click and drag elsewhere to define a second region: the center of the region will be labelled with a different letter.

.. tip:: **To define a region connected to another one:**

    1. Choose the **Tracker** tool (|tracker|) and **select the region** to which you want to connect another region.

    2. Click and drag elsewhere to define a connected region: the center of the region will be labelled with the same letter of the first one.

.. tip:: **To delete a defined region:**

    1. Choose the **Tracker** tool (|tracker|) and select the region you want to delete.

    2. Choose Edit  →  **Delete**.

.. tip:: **To track a defined region in a series of images:**

    1. Select the first image of the range you want to track.

    2. Choose the **Tracker** tool (|tracker|) and define the regions to be tracked.

    3. Select the frame range in the Xsheet/Timeline or in the Level Strip.

    4. Choose Level  →  **Tracking...**, set the tracking options and click the **Track** button.

.. tip:: **To link an object to the tracked region:**

    Link the object to one of the hooks defined by the tracking process (see  :ref:`Using Hooks <using_hooks>`  ).


.. _animating_objects:

Animating Objects
-----------------
You can animate the position, rotation, scale and shear (plus edit the center) of columns, pegbars, cameras and the table by using the Animate tool. Objects to be animated can be selected either in the Stage Schematic, the Viewer, the Xsheet/Timeline or by using a dropdown menu in the Animate tool's own options bar.

In the **Animate tool** (|animate|) options bar you can set the following:

    - **Object:**, lets you select which scene object is to be effected by the tool. Here will be listed all columns, cameras and pegbars created, plus the table itself.
    
    - **Mode:**, lets you choose which transformation options to display in the tool options bar. Options are: **Position**, **Rotation**, **Scale**, **Shear**, **Center** and **All**.

    - **Position**, **X:** and **Y:** set the horizontal and vertical positions of the selected object, **Z:** sets its position along the Z axis, for defining the depth of the object in 3D space (see  :ref:`Working in a 3D Environment <working_in_a_3d_environment>`  ), and **SO:** sets the column/layer stacking order, that can override the default one defined by the Xsheet column (or Timeline layer) order (see  :ref:`Changing Columns Stacking Order <changing_columns_stacking_order>`  ).

    |animate_tool_position|

    - **Rotation:**, sets the rotation of the selected object around the Z axis.

    |animate_tool_rotation|

    - **Scale**, **Global:**, **H:** and **V:** set the global, horizontal and vertical scaling of the selected object. **Maintain:** sets a constraint for scaling operations performed by using the Animate tool handle: if it is set to **A/R** the object will maintain its proportions, if it is set to **Mass** the object will maintain its overall volume.

    |animate_tool_scale|

    - **Shear**, **H:** and **V:** set the horizontal and vertical shearing of the selected object.

    |animate_tool_shear|

    - **Center**, **X:** and **Y:** set the horizontal and vertical position of the center of the selected object. The Center of an object cannot be animated.

    |animate_tool_center|

    - **All** displays all transformation types at the same time. In the viewer a handle will also be available that let users visually change any of the transformation types: Position, Rotation, Scale, Shear and Center.

    |animate_tool_all|

    - **Pick:** (only available in All mode) lets the user choose to automatically select columns/layers or pegbars to be animated when the selection is done by clicking in the Viewer: when set to **Column**, clicking a drawing automatically selects the related column/layer; when set to **Pegbar**, clicking a drawing automatically selects the pegbar to which the column/layer containing the drawing is linked (if there is one); when set to **None** the selection of drawings in the Viewer is disabled.

    - **Lock buttons** (|lock|) define which values remain locked while transforming the object.

    - **Global Key** when activated, sets a key for all of the object transformations as soon as a key is set for any of its transformations interactively in the viewer. For example if you change the position of an object, thus defining a keyframe for it, keys will also be automatically defined for the rotation, scaling and shearing transformations as well. This option will not take any effect if the values for the property are input directly in the toolbar, and not interactively.

.. note:: If the tool options bar is too short to display all the tool options, it can be scrolled by using arrow buttons available at its ends.

.. note:: Position values are expressed in the default unit of measure set in the Preferences...  →  Interface dialog (see  :ref:`Choosing the Working Unit <choosing_the_working_unit>`  ).


.. _animate_tool_handle:

Animate Tool Handle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the Animation tool is in **All** mode, you can also interactively control transformation values by using the handle available in the viewer. The handle is made of an inner double circle with three arms that allow you to change any of the following transformations:

|animate_tool_handle|

.. note:: As you roll over the handles, the cursor changes shape to indicate to you the operations you may perform. 

.. note:: For greater precision it is possible to keep the **Alt** key depressed before starting to perform any transformation. 

- **Position:** Click and drag anywhere to move the object; if the **Shift** key is pressed while dragging, the movement will be constrained in the horizontal or vertical direction.

- **Rotate:** Click and drag the circle end to rotate the object;

|animate_tool_handle_rotate|

- **Scale:** Click and drag the outer square of the double-square end to scale the object uniformly on the vertical and horizontal; click and drag the inner square of the double-square end to scale the object according to the constraint set in the options bar; if no constraint is set and the **Shift** key is pressed while dragging, the scaling will be uniform.

|animate_tool_handle_scale|
|animate_tool_handle_scaleHV|

- **Shear:** Click and drag the parallelogram end to shear the object; if the **Shift** key is pressed while dragging, the shearing will be constrained in the horizontal or vertical direction.

|animate_tool_handle_shear|

- **Center:** Click and drag the double circle at the center to change the center of the object.

|animate_tool_handle_center|

.. note:: The object center can be moved, but cannot be animated. Once it is set, or modified, it is retained in that position during all of the animation. If the Center is changed many times, and you want to set it back to its original position, right-click the object in the Stage Schematic and choose **Reset Center** from the menu that opens.

When entering a value or operating the handle, a keyframe will be automatically generated at the current frame only for the set transformation; if the **Global Key** option is activated, keys will be generated for all of the transformations.

If you want to set a key for an object transformation, maintaining its value as it is at the current frame, you can just press **Enter** on the displayed value. If you want to set keys for all of the object transformations maintaining their values as they are at the current frame, you can use the **Set Key** button (|key|) available in the bottom bar of the viewer; in this case keys are created for all of the object transformations, regardless of the **Global Key** option.

.. note:: Objects can also be animated by working in the Function Editor (see  :ref:`Editing Curves and Numerical Columns <editing_curves_and_numerical_columns>`  ).

.. note:: The movement of the column contents can be checked by activating the Onion Skin mode, as it will display the position of drawings contained in the current column at different frames (see  :ref:`Using Onion Skin <using_onion_skin>`  ).

.. tip:: **To select the object to edit:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Select it in the stage schematic. 

    - If the object is a column/layer, select it in the Xsheet/Timeline.

    - Use the **Animate** tool (|animate|) with the **Pick:** option set to **Column** to click a drawing in the viewer to select the related column.

    - Use the **Animate** tool (|animate|) with the **Pick:** option set to **Pegbar** to click a drawing in the viewer to select the pegbar that the column containing the drawing is linked to.

    - Right-click in the Viewer a drawing to select an object from the list of scene objects. 

.. tip:: **To animate an object with the Animate tool:**

    1. Select the object you want to animate.

    2. Choose the **Animate** tool (|animate|). 

    3. Set the frame where you want to define the key by doing one of the following:

    - Move the current frame cursor in the Xsheet/Timeline or in the Function Editor.

    - Use the Frame bar or the Playback buttons in the bottom bar of the viewer.

    - When animating columns only, select the related cell in the column/layer.

    4. Define a keyframe.

    5. Select a different frame, and go on defining keyframes.

.. tip:: **To define a keyframe only for some object transformations:**

    1. Deactivate the **Global Key** option in the tool options bar.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - Enter values in the **Animate** tool options bar for the object transformations you want to set a key for. 

    - If in **All** mode, operate the handle to move, scale, rotate or shear the object, automatically generating a key only for the modified transformation. 

    .. note:: As this keyframe is partial and refers only to some transformations, the **Set Key** button turns striped-blue.

.. tip:: **To define a keyframe for all the object transformations:**

    1. Activate the **Global Key** option in the tool options bar.

    2. Interactively move, rotate, scale or shear the object in the viewer. 

    .. note:: As this keyframe is global and refers to all the transformations, the **Set Key** button turns blue.

.. tip:: **To define a key for an object transformation leaving its value as it is at the current frame:**

    1. Deactivate the **Global Key** option in the tool options bar.

    2. In the **Animate** tool options bar click in the field of the object transformations you want to set a key for, and press the **Enter** key. 

    .. note:: As this keyframe is partial and refers only to some transformations, the **Set Key** button turns striped-blue.

.. tip:: **To define keys for all of the object transformations leaving their values as they are at the current frame:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Click the **Set Key** button (|key|).

    - When animating columns/layers only, right-click in the column/layer cell and choose **Set Key** from the menu that opens. 

    .. note:: As this keyframe is global and refers to all the transformations, the **Set Key** button turns blue.

.. tip:: **To turn a partial keyframe to a global key:**

    Click the **Set Key** button (|key|): it turns from blue-striped to blue.

.. tip:: **To remove a set keyframe from the viewer bottom bar:**

    Do one of the following:

    - If the keyframe is global, click the **Set Key** button (|key|): it turns from blue to grey.

    - If the keyframe is partial, click twice the **Set Key** button (|key|): with the first click it turns from striped-blue to blue, with the second from blue to grey.

.. tip:: **To navigate frames where keyframes are defined in the viewer bottom bar:**

    Use the **Previous Key** (|prevkey|) and **Next Key** (|next_key|) buttons available at the side of the Set Key button.

.. note:: Keys can also be removed or navigated by working in the Function Editor (see  :ref:`Editing Curves and Numerical Columns <editing_curves_and_numerical_columns>`  ).

.. tip:: **To customize the Animate tool options bar:**

    Do any of the following:

    - Use the **Tool Mode:** dropdown menu to choose from one of its modes: Position, Rotate, Scale, Shear, Center or All: only the options for the selected transformation category will be displayed.

    - Use the **Lock** button (|lock|) to choose which transformations have to be locked while transforming the object: only selected items will be locked.


.. _changing_columns_stacking_order:

Changing Stacking Order of Columns/Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The column/layer stacking order, which sets which drawings and images are placed on top or behind, other images, by default depends on how columns/layers are placed in the Xsheet/Timeline: Xsheet direction is from left to right, while Timeline direction is from bottom to top, making what's on the left/bottom to be behind of what's on the right/top. 

This would mean that if an animation element has to move behind another animation element and then in front of it, it'd have to be exposed in two different columns, one before and one after the column containing the second animation element.

By editing the **SO** (i.e. stacking order) value it's possible to change and animate the element compositing order without editing the columns/layers position in the Xsheet/Timeline.

The **SO** default value for all the columns is 0, meaning that the Xsheet column (or Timeline layer) order is what's taken into account when there are no modifications to the SO position. As soon as a column/layer has a higher SO value, it will be placed on top, regardless of the position of the column/layer in the Xsheet/Timeline; conversely if the SO value is lower it will be placed behind.

.. note:: In case a column/layer's Z position is edited, columns/layers closer to the camera will be composited on top of others, ignoring both its Xsheet/Timeline order and its SO value (see  :ref:`Working in a 3D Environment <working_in_a_3d_environment>` ).

.. tip:: **To edit and animate a column/layer SO value:**

    1. Select the column/layer to which you want to edit the SO value.

    2. Choose the **Animate** tool (|animate|). 

    3. Set the frame where you want to define the key.

    4. In the tool options bar enter the value in the **SO** field.

    .. note:: Columns/layers **SO** values can also be edited and animated by working in the Function Editor (see  :ref:`Editing Curves and Numerical Columns <editing_curves_and_numerical_columns>`  ).


.. _creating_a_movement_along_a_motion_path:

Creating a Movement along a Motion Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objects can be moved along a motion path according to two different type of movements: one without changing the object orientation, and the other with an automatic orientation, set according to the direction of the motion path.

A motion path can be assigned to an object node in the Stage Schematic, and it can be defined with drawing tools and edited in the viewer as if it was a vector drawing. Once defined, it's displayed as a dashed red line, with small numbers indicating the control points defining the vector stroke.


.. figure:: /_static/movements/motion_path.png

   A motion path assigned to pegbar 2.


As soon as a path is assigned to an object's node, the object will be automatically placed at the beginning of the path according to its center, and it will only be able to move along it (and not in the standard X and Y directions anymore).

The keyframes of the object on the motion path can be defined by dragging the object along it, and they are *expressed as a percentage* where 0% is the starting point and 100% is the ending point of the path. 

It's also possible to link the keyframes of the objects to the positions of the control points defining the motion path, so that they remain consistent when the motion path is edited. To help you better understand where the control points are, the object snaps to them when it is dragged along the motion path.

.. note:: If you want to change the center of the object, you can move it using the **Animate** tool (|animate|), and then use the **Reset Center** command in the Stage Schematic.

.. note:: A motion path can also be created by copying and pasting a drawing vector stroke, and conversely a drawing vector stroke can be created by copying and pasting a motion path.

.. tip:: **To create a motion path:**

    1. Select the object for which you want to define a motion path.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - Click the **New Motion Path** button (|new_motion_path|) in the bottom bar of the stage window.

    - Right-click in the stage and choose **New Motion Path** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To define and edit a motion path:**

    Select the motion path node in the stage and do any of the following:

    - Use the drawing tools to define it in the viewer.

    - Use the modifier tools to edit it. 

    - Draw a new line, and confirm in the dialog that opens, to replace a previously created motion path with the new one. 

.. tip:: **To assign a motion path to an object:**

    Click and drag the motion path top port to the object node bottom port. 

.. tip:: **To remove a motion path from an object:**

    1. Select the link between the object and the motion path. 

    2. Choose Edit  →  **Delete**.

.. tip:: **To set the type of movement along a motion path:**

    Click the button at *the far left* of the object bottom port to switch between two options: the **Square** button (|square|) will preserve the object's original orientation, and the **Rotated Square** button (|rhomb|) will automatically rotate the object according to the motion path's direction.

.. tip:: **To link the object keyframes to the control points defining the motion path:**

    Click the button *next to* the object bottom port to activate or deactivate the **Link to Control Points** option (|link_to_control_points|).

.. tip:: **To change the center of the object:**

    1. Choose the **Animate** tool (|animate|).

    2. Move the center of the object to the new position.

    3. Right-click the object node in the Stage Schematic and select **Reset Center** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To save a motion path:**

    1. Right-click it and select **Save Motion Path** from the menu that opens. 

    2. In the browser choose a location and a name and click the **Save** button. The file will be saved with the MPATH extension.

    1. Right-click the motion path and select **Load Motion Path** from the menu that opens. 

    2. In the browser retrieve the MPATH file you want to load and click the Load button.

.. tip:: **To use a drawing vector stroke as a motion path:**

    1. Select the vector stroke you want to use as a motion path with the **Selection** tool (|selection|).

    2. Copy/cut it.

    3. Select the motion path you want to paste to, in the Stage Schematic.

    4. Click in the viewer and paste the copied/cut vector that will automatically become the motion path.

.. tip:: **To use a motion path as a vector stroke in a drawing:**

    1. Select the motion path in the Stage Schematic.

    2. Select the motion path with the **Selection** tool (|selection|) in the viewer.

    3. Copy/cut it.

    4. Select the drawing where you want to paste the new stroke.

    5. Paste the copied/cut motion path that will automatically become a stroke.

.. tip:: **To remove a motion path from the Stage Schematic:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Select the motion path node and choose Edit  →  **Delete**.

    - Right-click the motion path node and choose **Delete** from the menu that opens.


.. _using_column_keys:

Using Keys in Columns/Layers
----------------------------
When columns/layers are animated, their animation can be controlled in a quick way by managing keyframes and interpolations directly in the Xsheet or Timeline, with no need to use the Function Editor.

As soon as a keyframe is defined for a column/layer, a **Key icon** is displayed on the right of the column/layer cell to which it refers; the key is displayed regardless of how many parameters are animated. Keys can be moved within the column/layer they refer to, and selected in order to be cut/copied and pasted from one cell to another. 

|using_column_keys|

When the **Global Key** option is activated for the **Animate** tool, and the default interpolation is not set to **Linear**, as soon as at least two keyframes are created for a column, **a line connecting them with two arrowheads** is displayed (see  :ref:`Animating Objects <animating_objects>`  and  :ref:`Setting Segment Interpolations <setting_segment_interpolations>`  ). The two arrowheads divide the line into three sections indicating the speed in, the constant speed, and speed out phases *of all the transformations defined*. This allows you to control the speed of the movement between the two keys as you wish, including a constant speed movement.

You can also cycle previously created keys, in order to repeat automatically all the previously defined keys for the whole length of the scene, with no need to copy and paste keys from cells to cells.

All animations and interpolations set for the column/layer can be visible and edited with the Function Editor. When you edit any column/layer transformation in the Function Editor, the arrowheads will not be displayed anymore between keys, to stress the fact that a specific interpolation has been modified with the Function Editor. If needed, you can **Reset** the whole column/layer transformation to the default interpolation values, and make the arrowheads available again (see  :ref:`Editing Curves and Numerical Columns <editing_curves_and_numerical_columns>`  ). 

.. tip:: **To modify a key:**

    1. Select the cell the key refers to.

    2. Do one of the following:

    - Use the **Animate** tool (|animate|) to modify position and size.

    - Enter values you want to modify in the Animate tool (|animate|) options bar. 

.. tip:: **To select keys:**

    Do one of the following:

    - **Click a key icon** to select it.

    - **Click a key icon and drag** to select a range of keys on different columns and at different frames.

    - **Shift-click** to extend the selection to a specific key. 

    - **Ctrl-click** (PC) or **Cmd-click** (Mac) to add to, or remove a key to the selection.

    - **Right-click** a key icon and choose the related command from the menu that opens to perform specific selections, such as all keys in the row, all previous ones, all following ones, etc.

.. tip:: **To move a key selection:**

    Click any of the selected keys and drag the selection to the new position. Dragging is allowed only inside its own column/layer.

.. tip:: **To edit a key selection:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Use the **Cut** command to eliminate the selection from the scene and keep it in memory for further operations.

    - Use the **Copy** command to keep the selection in memory for further operations.

    - Use the **Paste** command to paste the selection kept in memory starting from the selected cell. 

    - Use the **Delete** command to delete the selection.

    .. note:: All these commands are also available in the menu that opens when right-clicking the key icon.

.. tip:: **To set the speed of the movement or transformation:**

    **Click the arrowheads** available on the line connecting two subsequent keys, **and drag them up or down** to the new position. In particular:

    - To set a **constant speed**, drag the top arrowhead close to the first key icon to eliminate the ease in section, and the bottom arrowhead close to the second key icon to eliminate the ease out section.

    - To set a **continuous acceleration**, drag both arrowheads close to the second key icon in order to increase the speed in section.

    - To set a **continuous deceleration**, drag both arrowheads close to the first key icon in order to increase the speed out section.

.. tip:: **To make the arrowheads available when they are not:**

    Right-click the line connecting two subsequent keys and choose **Reset Interpolation** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To activate/deactivate the cycling of previously created keys:**

    Click the **Circular arrow** icon (|circular_arrow|) visible after the last key of a series.The cells affected by the cycled movement are marked on the right by *a zigzagged line*. 

.. tip:: **To open the Function Editor:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Double-click a key. 

    - Right-click a key and choose **Function Editor** from the menu that opens.


.. _working_with_multiple_column_keys:

Working with Multiple Column/Layer Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to insert or delete keys affecting the Xsheet/Timeline as a whole, or a selection of Xsheet columns (or Timeline layers). 

Inserting or deleting multiple keys allows you to manage keys for several columns/layers at the same time, for instance when you are working on a cutout animation where keys may be required for all the columns/layers where model sections are exposed (see  :ref:`Creating Cutout Animation <creating_cutout_animation>`  ). 

.. note:: Inserted keys are created for all the column transformations.

When a multiple key is inserted at the current frame, a key is created for each Xsheet column (or Timeline layer) where an animation level is exposed; if a column/layer selection is defined, keys are created in selected columns/layers only (see  :ref:`Working with Xsheet Columns <working_with_xsheet_columns>`  ).

When a multiple key is deleted at the current frame, any key available in any Xsheet column (or Timeline layer) at the current frame is deleted; if a column/layer selection is defined, keys are deleted in selected columns/layers only.

.. tip:: **To create several keys at once:**

    1. Do one of the following:

    - Select the columns/layers for which you want to create keys.

    - Select no column by clicking anywhere in the Xsheet/Timeline, to create keys for all the columns/layers.

    2. Select the frame where you want to insert keys.

    3. Choose Xsheet  →  **Insert Multiple Keys**.

.. tip:: **To remove several keys at once:**

    1. Do one of the following:

    - Select the columns/layers from which you want to delete keys.

    - Select no column by clicking anywhere in the Xsheet/Timeline, to delete keys from all the columns/layers.

    2. Select the frame where you want to delete keys.

    3. Choose Xsheet  →  **Remove Multiple Keys**.


.. _working_in_a_3d_environment:

Working in a 3D Environment
---------------------------
You can place and move cameras, the table, pegbars and columns/layers in a 3D environment, as if they were elements on a real 3D stage. 

This means that it's possible to move the camera automatically generating a multiplane effect, or truck it through characters and elements simulating a perspective effect, or create complex 3D motion paths for any element by combining a depth movement with movements in the X and Y directions.

The 3D environment can be activated, or deactivated, with the **3D View** button (|3d|) available in the Viewer title bar. When activated, the viewer displays the cone of the camera and all of the scene contents along the Z axis, which is the direction from the camera to the table. The area displayed can be moved and rotated to set the best viewing angle, and a side or top viewpoint can be set. 

By default all the pegbars and columns are on the table: their Z position is equal to the number of horizontal fields defined for the default camera (as the value represents the size of the area that is shot by the camera) (see  :ref:`Defining Camera Settings <defining_camera_settings>`  ). By increasing the field value, objects are placed farther from the camera; by decreasing it, objects are placed closer to the camera; at zero they are at the same Z position as the camera, and for negative values they are behind the camera.

As concerning the camera, by default its Z position is equal to the number of horizontal fields defined for the default camera. By increasing the field value, the camera moves farther from the table; by decreasing it, it moves closer; at zero it is at the same Z position of the table and for negative values it is behind the table.

As soon as objects are moved, *projections on an imaginary floor and side wall* let you understand the position of the drawings in relation to each other and to the camera. If the current object is a column/layer, a dotted bounding box displays the area of it currently being shot by the camera.

The size of the objects changes according to its Z position, like in a real 3D environment, decreasing when an object is farther from the camera and increasing when closer. To keep control of this behaviour it's possible to define an additional Z position value in the tool options bar, that sets the position at which the object has to keep its original size. 

.. note:: Columns closer to the camera are displayed on top of others, ignoring the Xsheet/Timeline order and the **SO** value. In case two or several columns have exactly the same distance, the **SO** value prevails; if two or several columns have exactly the same distance and SO value, the Xsheet column (or Timeline layer) order prevails (see  :ref:`Changing Columns Stacking Order <changing_columns_stacking_order>`  ).

.. tip:: **To enter the 3D environment:**

    Click the **3D View** button (|3d|) available on the right of the viewer title bar.

.. tip:: **To set an object position in the 3D environment:**

    1. Activate the **3D View**.

    2. Select the object you want to move.

    3. Select the **Animate** tool (|animate|).

    4. Do one of the following:

    - Enter a value for the **Z** position in the tool options bar.

    - Use the **double-arrow handle** parallel to the floor of the 3D environment, to move the selected object and set its Z position.

.. tip:: **To set at which position the object has to keep its original size:**

    Enter a value for the **additional Z position** field *displayed in brackets* in the tool options bar. For example if you want a column content to keep its original size when placed at the Z position 8, also enter 8 as the value in brackets.

.. tip:: **To move the work area displayed in 3D:**

    Select the **Hand** tool (|hand|) and drag in the viewer.

.. tip:: **To rotate the work area displayed in 3D:**

    Select the **Rotate** tool (|rotate|) and drag in the viewer.

.. tip:: **To set a side or a top view:**

    Do one of the following:

    - To set a **Side view** use the button (|side_view|) available on the side wall of the 3D environment.

    - To set a **Top view** use the button (|top_view|) available on the floor of the 3D environment.

.. tip:: **To exit the 3D environment:**

    Click the **Camera Stand** (|camera_stand|) or **Camera View** (|camera_view|) buttons available on the right of the viewer title bar.
