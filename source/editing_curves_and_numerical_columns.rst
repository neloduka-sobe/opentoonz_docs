Editing Using Spreadsheet and Curves
====================================

| Changes in Object transformations and effects parameters are shown in the **Function Editor** window, where keyframes and their related interpolations can be controlled and modified by using a *Spreadsheet* of numerical columns or a *Graph Editor*.

| The **Spreadsheet** displays changes in columns where each column represents a single animatable parameter and each row shows the value of a parameter at each frame.
| Blank cells represent the absence of a change in a parameters value due to no keyframes being defined.

| The **Graph Editor** displays changes as curves in a graph, where frames are laid horizontally and values are laid vertically.
| Keyframes are represented as points and the interpolated values between them are visualized as red lines.

The spreadsheet's columns and the graph editor's curves are different representations of the same data, so any changes made in one view are also reflected in the other.


.. _using_the_function_editor:

Using the Function Editor
-------------------------
 
|function_editor_1|

The function editor window is divided into three sections. On the left there is an area where the Spreadsheet or Graph Editor is displayed, on the right top is an area where the interpolation of the current transformation segment is displayed, and on the right bottom is the objects/effects tree.

The tree has two main item folders, *Stage* and *FX*: in the first you can find folders for the defined cameras, the table, used pegbars and columns; in the second one you can find folders for each used effect. Each folder contains the related transformation parameters.

The objects/effects tree tells if the object/effect is animated and which parameter is animated, by using the following icons:

- A plain folder is for non-animated objects/effects.

- A folder with an arrow is for animated objects/effects.

- An icon with a dotted straight line is for non-animated parameters.

- An icon with a continuos curve is for animated parameters.

Clicking these icons allows you to select which object/effect and which parameters have to be displayed as a spreadsheet or curves in the area on the left.

Transformation data can be saved and loaded as a CURVE file, to allow the exporting and importing from one scene to another, and they can be exported as well as a DAT file in order to be used in other software.

.. _defining_key_values:

Defining keyframes
-------------------
Keyframes, including those belonging to object transformations done by using the **Animate** tool (|animate|) and those defined for effects parameters in the **FX Settings** window, can be controlled and edited both using the Spreadsheet's numerical columns and the Graph Editor's curves (see :ref:`Animating Objects <animating_objects>` and :ref:`Editing FX Settings <editing_fx_settings>`  ). 

In the Spreadsheet, keyframes are displayed as orange cells; in the Graph Editor, keyframes are represented as control points along the curve. In both cases they can be added, edited, moved and deleted.


.. _using_numerical_columns:

Using the Spreadsheet
'''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_spreadsheet|

The Spreadsheet displays transformations in columns like the ones available in the Xsheet/Timeline, having one for each parameter. For each frame, the column's cells display the related transformation values.

Keyframes are displayed in different-colored cells, and can be moved along the column to different frames positions. In-between values are automatically generated according to the keyframes and to the set interpolation (see  :ref:`Setting Segment Interpolations <setting_segment_interpolations>`  ).

All the columns referring to the same object or effects are grouped under one single header. For example under a pegbar header you can find all the columns referring to its transformations. 

Columns cells can be used to type in directly values for keys, edit or move them. Values contained in cells can be cut, copied and pasted, so that transformations can be displaced, repeated and deleted. 

.. tip:: **To define keyframes directly in Spreadsheet columns:**

    1. Double click in the column cell where you want to define a keyframe: the cell becomes editable.

    2. Type in the value for the key, and press **Enter** to confirm.

.. tip:: **To move a keyframe:**

    Click the *vertical strip* at the left of a keyframe cell, and drag it up or down to the new position; the in-between values change accordingly.

    - Click and drag to perform a selection; the selection can be extended to several columns.

    - Use the **Copy** command: the selection will be kept in memory for further operations.

    - Use the **Cut** command: the selection will be removed from the columns and will be kept in memory for further operations. The cells removal causes the following cells to shift up.

    - Use the **Paste** command: the selection kept in memory will be pasted starting from the selected insertion cell. The command causes the following cells to shift down.

    - Use the **Delete** command: selected cells will be deleted, causing the following cells to shift up.


.. _using_function_curves:

Using the Graph Editor
''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_grapheditor|

The Graph Editor displays transformations as curves in a graph where *time* is laid horizontally, and parameter *values* are laid vertically. 

Curves are defined by control points representing keyframes. Points can be easily added by working directly in the graph or using the **Set Key** button (|key|) in the top bar of the **Function Editor**. 

Control points can also be selected in order to be edited, moved or deleted. 

The **Set Key** button (|key|) is either *grey* when no keyframe is defined for the current curve at the current frame, or *blue* when a keyframe is defined for the current curve at the current frame.

Frames and keyframes can be navigated by using the related buttons in the top bar of the editor. The **Next Key** (|next_key|) and **Previous Key** buttons (|prevkey|) are available only if more than one keyframe is defined.

.. _setting_segment_interpolations:

Setting Segment Interpolations
------------------------------
A transformation segment, that is to say the section between two keyframes, can have different interpolations affecting the way the value changes from one key to another. The set interpolation will be displayed graphically in the Graph Editor, and as a series of values, one for each frame, in the Spreadsheet.

Available interpolations are the following: **Linear**, **Speed In / Speed Out**, **Ease In / Ease Out**, **Ease In / Ease Out %**, **Exponential**, **Expression**, **File**, **Constant** and **Similar Shape**. The Default Interpolation option can be set in the Preferences...  →  Animation dialog section, but it can be changed at any time in the interpolation area of the Function Editor, on the top right of the window.

In the same area it is also possible to define an interpolation **Step**, that is to say the number of frames for which the interpolation values have to be repeated, for instance to match a movement with an animation level exposed at a specific step. The default animation step can be set in the Preferences...  →  Animation dialog section.

.. tip:: **To set the type of interpolation for a segment in the Spreadsheet:**

    1. Move the current frame cursor to a frame belonging to a segment.

    2. Choose the interpolation from the option menu available in the **Interpolation:** area of the Function Editor.
    
    3. Click the **Apply** button to apply the desired change.

.. tip:: **To set the type of interpolation for multiple segments in the Spreadsheet:**

    1. Make a cell selection that encompases multiple keyframe segments.

    2. Right click on one of the selected cells and choose the desired interpolation type in the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To set a Linear interpolation:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Choose **Linear** from the option menu available in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor and click the **Apply** button.

    - Right-click the curve segment you want to set the interpolation for, and choose **Linear Interpolation** from the menu that opens.


.. _using_speed_in_/_speed_out_interpolations:

Using Speed In / Speed Out Interpolations
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_iSpeed|

When the interpolation is Speed In / Speed Out, both control points at the ends of the segment have handles whose direction and length define the slope of the curve, therefore the speed of the transformation. The handles direction and length can be set by entering values in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor, or by dragging the handles themselves.

By default the handles are linked, making their degree of movement dependent on adjacent segments in order to define a smooth curve, but the link can be broken in order to move the handle freely. For example if subsequent segments have the Speed In / Speed Out interpolation, the handles of the shared points share the same direction, but breaking the link each handle can have a different direction. 

Handles can also be collapsed in control points in order to turn them into corner points; in this case to retrieve the handles it is possible to reset their length and direction.

.. tip:: **To set a Speed In / Speed Out interpolation:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Choose **Speed In / Speed Out** from the dropdown menu available in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor and click the **Apply** button.

    - Right-click the curve segment you want to set the interpolation for, and choose **Speed In / Speed Out Interpolation** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To set the speed of the interpolation:**

    1. Select the keyframe at the beginning or at the end of the curve segment you want to edit, or the curve segment itself.

    2. Set the slope of the curve after or before the keyframe by doing one of the following:

    - Enter the **Speed In** and **Speed Out** direction and length values in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor and click the **Apply** button.

    - Click and drag the end of the handles to move them freely.

    - **Shift-click** and drag the end of the handles to move them with a constraint in the horizontal or vertical direction.

.. tip:: **To move a control point handle free from the adjacent segments:**

    Right-click the control point and choose **Unlink Handles** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To link back handles to adjacent segments:**

    Right-click the control point and choose **Link Handles** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To turn a control point into a corner point:**

    1. Select the control point.

    2. Move the handle ends to the control point, in order to collapse them.

.. tip:: **To retrieve handles from a corner point:**

    Right-click the control point and choose **Reset Handles** from the menu that opens.


.. _using_ease_in_/_ease_out_interpolations:

Using Ease In / Ease Out Interpolations
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_iEase|

When the interpolation is Ease In / Ease Out, the segment is divided into three sections by two vertical lines: the first section is an acceleration, the second is at constant speed, the third is a deceleration. The duration in frames of each section can be set by entering values in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor, or by dragging the vertical lines available on the segment.

.. tip:: **To set an Ease In / Ease Out interpolation:**

.. _using_exponential_interpolations:

Using Exponential Interpolations
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_iExpon|

When the interpolation is **Exponential** the curve segment turns to a curve that continually becomes steeper, because of that, the higher the frame, the faster the related value grows. Only positive values are significant for this interpolation.

.. tip:: **To set an Exponential interpolation:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Choose **Exponential** from the dropdown menu available in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor and click the **Apply** button.

    - Right-click the curve segment you want to set the transformation for, and choose **Exponential Interpolation** from the menu that opens.


.. _using_interpolations_based_on_expressions:

Using Interpolations Based on Expressions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_iExpres|

When the interpolation is defined by an Expression, the segment values come from a *mathematical formula* that can be typed by using algebra notations. In this case the keyframes at both ends of the segment may change as well, according to the typed expression.

While typing the expression, if the syntax is recognized, a menu automatically opens suggesting you the possible terms: from the menu you can select the term both to display in a tooltip box its correct syntax, and to insert it in the expression.

As soon as terms are recognized, different colors are used to highlight them: **operators and functions** are displayed in *dark blue*, **variables** in *light blue*, **constants** in *green*. When the expression is entered, any **syntax error** will be displayed in *red*.

The **Unit** used for the function is displayed in a box next to the expression; in case the unit refers to a movement, the default unit can be changed, and the values will be automatically converted to the default one.

Apart from the standard operators and functions, some variables and predefined functions can also be used in expressions. 

Supported terms are the following:

.. _using_transformation_references:

Using Transformation References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to use in expressions references to any *object*, *effect* or *Plastic vertex* transformation. In this way, expressions can be used to create relationships between different transformations belonging to different items that can be of any of the aforementioned types.

The syntax to create a reference to an object transformation is the following:

``object.transformation`` or ``object.transformation(delta)`` 

where ``object``  is the ID name of a *camera*, *column*, *pegbar* or the *table*, as can be read in the Stage and FX Schematic nodes' tooltips; ``transformation`` can be any of its available transformations; and ``delta`` is the difference between the target frame and the current one.

For example ``camera1.y``  refers to the Y position of the Camera1.
Whereas ``camera1.y(f-5)``  refers to the Y position of the Camera1, 5 frames before the current frame.

Supported terms are the following:

===========================  =============================  
**Objects**                                               
===========================  =============================  
``cam<n>`` , ``camera<n>``   Refer to the camera ``n`` .    
``col<n>``                   Refers to the column ``n`` .   
``peg<n>`` , ``pegbar<n>``   Refer to the pegbar ``n`` .        
``tab`` , ``table``          Refer to the table.            
===========================  =============================  



=====================================  ======================================================  
**Transformations**                                                                            
=====================================  ======================================================  
``x`` , ``y``                          Refer to the horizontal and vertical position.          
``path`` , ``pos``                     Refer to the position along the motion path.            
``rot``                                Refers to the rotation around the z axis.                                 
``scale`` , ``scaleh`` , ``scalev``    Refer to the global, horizontal and vertical scaling.   
``shearh`` , ``shearv``                Refer to the horizontal and vertical shear.             
``z``                                  Refers to the position along the z axis.                
=====================================  ======================================================  


The syntax to create a reference to an effect parameter is the following:

``fx.name.parameter`` or ``fx.name.parameter(delta)`` 

where ``name``  is the ID name of an *effect*, as can be read in the FX Schematic nodes' tooltips, ``parameter`` is any of the available effect parameters, and ``delta`` is the difference between the target frame and the current one. 

When an effect parameter has multiple sub-parameters, for example the Center parameter has X and Y sub-parameters, the syntax has to be the following:

``fx.name.parameter.subparameter`` or ``fx.name.parameter.subparameter(delta)`` 

where ``name``  can be any used effect, ``parameter``  the main effect parameter, ``subparameter``  is the effect sub-parameter, and ``delta`` is the difference between the target frame and the current one.

For example ``fx.blur2.value``  refers to the Value parameter of the effect Blur2; ``fx.blur2.value(f-5)``  refers to the Value parameter of the effect Blur2, 5 frames before the current frame; and ``fx.raylit1.center.x``  refers to the X sub-parameter of the Center parameter of the effect Raylit1.

.. note:: If the effect parameter name consists of several words, they have to be typed in expressions *without* blank spaces.


The syntax to create a reference to a Plastic vertex transformation is the following:

``vertex(column_number, "vertex_name").transformation`` or ``vertex(column_number, "vertex_name").transformation(delta)`` 

where ``column_number``  is the ID number of the *column* in which the referenced vertex exist, ``vertex_name``  is the exact name of the referenced Plastic vertex, ``transformation``  is any of the available vertex transformations (see below), and ``delta`` is the difference between the target frame and the current one. 

=====================================  ==========================================================  
**Plastic Vertex Transformations**                                                                            
=====================================  ==========================================================  
``angle``                              Refers to the angle between the vertex and its parent.    
``distance``                           Refers to the distance between the vertex and its parent. 
``so``                                 Refers to the vertex sorting order.

.. _using_interpolations_based_on_file_data:

Using Interpolations Based on File Data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_iFile|

When an interpolation is based on File data, the segment values are retrieved from the contents of a file. In this case the keyframes at both ends of the segment may change as well, according to the file data.

The file can be created by an external device or other applications, such as motion-control cameras or 3D software; supported file formats are BAT, DAT, RTF and TXT.

The value for each frame is taken from the file content, that must consist of a series of numbers listed in several lines. 

In case the file contains several values in each line, it is possible to define which value in each line has to be used by specifying a column number. For example, if you have a file like this:

100, 200, 300

101, 201, 301

102, 202, 302

the value 2 will cause 200, 201, 202 to be loaded.

The unit used for the data is displayed in a box next to the file path; in case the unit refers to a movement, the default unit can be changed, and the values will be automatically converted to the default one.

.. tip:: **To set an interpolation based on File data:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Choose **File** from the option menu available in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor and click the **Apply** button.

    - Right-click the curve segment you want to set the transformation for, and choose **File Interpolation** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To set the File information:**

    1. Type in the **File Path** field, or use the browser button, to set the path to the data file.

    2. Specify which value in each line has to be used by specifying the **Column** number.

    3. If the File data refers to a movement, change the unit if needed.

.. note:: If in the Browser you choose any project default folder, in the path field the full path will be replaced by the related default folder alias (see  :ref:`Project Default Folders <project_default_folders>`  ).


.. _using_constant_interpolations:

Using Constant Interpolations
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_iConst|

When an interpolation is **Constant**, the segment values are always equal to the value of the first key defining the segment.

.. tip:: **To set a Constant interpolation:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Choose **Constant** from the option menu available in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor and click the **Apply** button.

    - Right-click the curve segment you want to set the interpolation for, and choose **Constant Interpolation** from the menu that opens.


.. _using_interpolations_based_on_similar_shapes:

Using Interpolations Based on Similar Shapes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

|function_editor_iSimilar|

When the interpolation is based on a Similar Shape, the segment values changes according to the shape of the curve you specify as reference (see  :ref:`Using Transformation References <using_transformation_references>`  ). As soon as the interpolation is set, whenever the reference curve is edited, the segment will change accordingly.

This interpolation proves useful when you want to control at once several curves: if all of them share the same reference curve, by modifying the reference curve you will modify automatically all the curves referring to it.

It is also possible to set a **Frame Offset** value so that the interpolation will refer not to the same frame range of the reference curve, but to a different one.

.. tip:: **To set an interpolation based on a Similar Shape:**

    Do one of the following:

    - Choose **Similar Shape** from the option menu available in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor and click the **Apply** button.

    - Right-click the curve segment you want to set the transformation for, and choose **Similar Shape Interpolation** from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To set the reference curve:**

    1. Set the **Reference Curve:** in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor by typing the reference to an object or an effect transformation by using the appropriate syntax (see  :ref:`Using Transformation References <using_transformation_references>`  ). 

    2. Set a **Frame Offset** in the Interpolation area of the Function Editor if you want the interpolation to refer not to the same frame range of the reference curve, but to a different one.
    
    3. Click the **Apply** button to apply the desired change.

Controlling Several Function Curves at the Same Time
----------------------------------------------------
It's possible to control the keys and the interpolations of all the function curves visualized in the Function Editor by using widgets available in a horizontal strip at the top of the **Graph Editor** area, below the frame ruler.

This allows you to define keys and control the interpolation speed for different curves at the same time, such as a camera truck and pan, or an effect animation and a pegbar movement.

With respect to keys, a keyframe is visible in the strip for each keyframe defined for any curve visible in the Graph Editor; a line connects the keyframes for all the frames where there is an animation going on. The strip keyframe can be moved, automatically moving the keyframes it refers to; in case the strip keyframe refers to keyframes at the same frame in several curves, all the keyframes will move along. 

With respect to interpolation, if all the visible curves have a key at the same specific frame, and the segment on the side of the key has the same **Ease In / Ease Out** value or the same **Speed In / Speed Out** horizontal component, a marker will be visible in the strip on the side of the strip keyframes. The marker shaped as an *opening square bracket* is for the segment to the right of the keyframe, the one shaped like a *closing square bracket* is for the segment on the left of the keyframe. The markers can be moved, automatically changing the **Ease In / Ease Out** or the **Speed In / Speed Out** values of all the segments they refer to. 

.. tip:: **To set which curves have to be controlled:**

    Display the curves in the Graph Editor (see  :ref:`Using the Graph Editor <using_function_curves>`  ). 

.. tip:: **To add a keyframe:**

    Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) the frame ruler where you want to add the keyframe: a keyframe will be added to all the visible curves.

.. tip:: **To move a keyframe:**

    Click and drag the strip keyframe: all the keyframes it refers to will move along.

.. tip:: **To control the speed of the interpolation:**

    Move the markers visible on the sides of the strip keyframes.
