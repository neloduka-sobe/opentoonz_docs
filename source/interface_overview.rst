Interface Overview
==================

|UI_1|

OpenToonz interface is organized into rooms, also known as workspaces: each room is a different collection of windows which are laid out at specific positions on the screen. 


.. _using_rooms:

Using Rooms
-----------

|UI_rooms|

Available rooms are listed on the far right of the menu bar. Each of them always displays the content of the current scene.

Rooms can be named and their order can be rearranged. New rooms can be added and existing rooms can be deleted. When a room is added it is empty; to configure it, panes can be added one by one (see below).


.. tip:: **To enter a room:**

    Click the related tab on the far right of the menu bar.

.. tip:: **To name a room:**

    Double-click the tab and type the name you want to assign to the room.

.. tip:: **To order room tabs:**

    Click and drag the tab to the new position.

.. tip:: **To add a new room:**

    Right-click in the room tab area and choose New Room from the menu that opens.

.. tip:: **To delete a room:**

    Right-click the room tab and choose Delete Room "<Name>" from the menu that opens. The current room cannot be deleted.

.. tip:: **To return to the set of rooms provided with OpenToonz:**

    Choose Windows  →  Workspace  →  **Reset to Default Rooms**.


.. _customizing_rooms:

Customizing Rooms
'''''''''''''''''
Rooms can be modified by setting different sizes to different panes, and adding or removing panes. To prevent the accidental addition or removal of panes, rooms configuration can be locked.

Most of the panes can be maximized to fill the full interface, and can be added as floating windows by using the Windows menu.


.. tip:: **To resize a pane in the room:**

    Click any vertical or horizontal separator and drag it to the new position.

.. note:: Some panes like the toolbar and the level strip have some fixed size, therefore they cannot be resized.

.. tip:: **To open a pane as a floating window:**

    Select in the Windows menu the pane you want to open.

.. tip:: **To resize a floating window:**

    Click and drag the border or corner of a window.

.. tip:: **To close a floating window or a dialog:**

    Click the close button at the right of the title bar.

.. tip:: **To add a pane to a room:**

    1. Use the Windows menu to open the pane as a floating window.

    2. Click and drag its title bar to move it around and release to dock it according to the highlighted insertion point.

.. note:: Trying to dock a pane to the leftmost/rightmost part of the interface may fail if the main OpenToonz window is maximized at that moment. To overcome this, you can restore the main window size, dock the desired pane, and then maximize it back.

.. tip:: **To remove a pane from a room:**

    1. Click and drag the title bar of the pane you want to remove to undock it from the room.

    2. Close the floating window.

.. tip:: **To maximize, or minimize a maximized pane:**

    Double-click its title bar.

.. note:: Some panes like the toolbar and the level strip have some fixed size, therefore they cannot be maximized. 

.. tip:: **To lock/unlock the rooms configuration:**

    Activate/deactivate the Windows  →  Workspace  →  **Lock Room Panes** option.

.. _customizing_the_interface_appearance:

Customizing the Interface Appearance
------------------------------------
The appearance of the OpenToonz interface can be customized to suit any production need by choosing a specific language and interface theme.

OpenToonz allows users to choose a specific language for the software interface, including menus, commands, tooltips, and on-screen messages. Currently available languages are: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Chinese.

There are also several included themes to choose from: Default, Blue, Dark, Light and Neutral.

.. figure:: /_static/UI/themes.png

   The OpenToonz interface theme set to *Default* and to *Light*.

The interface themes are defined by means of a QSS file, whose concepts, terminology, and syntax are inspired by CSS files (HTML Cascading Style Sheets). The QSS files also refers to a set of PNG images that are used to create interface widgets. 

These files are stored in a folder named as the QSS file, and located in the ``C:\OpenToonz stuff\config\qss``  folder on Windows and ``OpenToonz stuff\config\qss``  folder on Macintosh. 

.. note:: The QSS file for Macintosh is named with the _mac suffix.

The QSS file can be edited with any text editor software, e.g. Notepad or TextEdit; the PNG images with any image editor software. Editing the QSS file requires some skill in CSS language, but some changes like colors of pane elements, can be easily done by expressing them with red, green and blue values.

.. note:: The QSS files defining the colors and the images used in the OpenToonz interface have to be written according to a specific syntax, otherwise OpenToonz interface will not be displayed properly. If you decide to edit a QSS file, make a backup copy first in case you need to revert the file to the original version.

.. tip:: **To choose the interface language:**

    1. Choose File  →  Preferences...  →  Interface.

    2. In the Language* option menu choose the language you want to use in the interface.

    3. Restart OpenToonz to have the interface in the selected language.

.. tip:: **To choose the interface theme:**

    1. Choose File  →  Preferences...  →  Interface.

    2. In the Theme option menu choose the style to be applied to the interface.

.. tip:: **To create a new theme:**

    1. Navigate to ``C:\OpenToonz stuff\config\qss``  folder on Windows and ``OpenToonz stuff\config\qss``  folder on Macintosh.

    2. Duplicate one of the already existing style folder.

    3. Rename the folder and the QSS files inside it with the name you want to assign to the style.

    4. Edit the QSS file and the PNG images contained in the new folder.

.. note:: The new style will be available in the Preferences dialog the next time you run OpenToonz.

.. tip:: **To edit style QSS file:**

    Open and edit with a text editor software (e.g. Notepad or TextEdit) the QSS files available in the style folder.

.. tip:: **To edit style images:**

    Open and edit with an image editor software the PNG files available in the style folder.
